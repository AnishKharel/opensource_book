</h2>
<section class="introduction" id="introduction-21"><p id="p-473">If you could read only one section to get going with Git, this would be the one to read. This section covers every basic command you need to do the vast majority of the things you’ll eventually spend your time doing with Git. By the end of this section, you should be able to configure and initialize a repository, begin and stop tracking files, and stage and commit changes. You will also learn how to set up Git to ignore certain files and file patterns, how to undo mistakes quickly and easily, how to browse the history of your project and view changes between commits, and how to push and pull from remote repositories.</p></section><section class="subsection" id="_getting_a_repo"><h3 class="heading hide-type">
<span class="type">Subsection</span> <span class="codenumber">5.3.1</span> <span class="title">Getting a Git Repository</span>
</h3>
<p id="p-474">You typically obtain an existing Git repository in one of two ways:</p>
<ol id="p-475" class="decimal">
<li id="li-126"><p id="p-476">You can take an existing local directory that is currently not under version control, and turn it into a Git repository, or</p></li>
<li id="li-127"><p id="p-477">You can <em class="emphasis">clone</em> an existing Git repository from elsewhere.</p></li>
</ol>
<p id="p-478">In either case, you end up with a Git repository on your local machine, ready for work.</p>
<section class="paragraphs" id="_initializing_a_repository_in_an_existing_directory"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Initializing a Repository in an Existing Directory.</span></h4>
<p id="p-479">If you have a project directory that is currently not under version control and you want to start controlling it with Git, you first need to go to that project’s directory. If you’ve never done this, it looks a little different depending on which system you’re running:</p>
<p id="p-480">for Linux:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">$ cd /home/user/my_project
</pre>
<p id="p-481">for macOS:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">$ cd /Users/user/my_project
</pre>
<p id="p-482">for Windows:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">$ cd C:/Users/user/my_project
</pre>
<p id="p-483">and type:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">$ git init
</pre>
<p id="p-484">This creates a new subdirectory named <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">.git</code> that contains all of your necessary repository files — a Git repository skeleton. At this point, nothing in your project is tracked yet.</p>
<p id="p-485">If you want to start version-controlling existing files (as opposed to an empty directory), you should probably begin tracking those files and do an initial commit. You can accomplish that with a few <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git add</code> commands that specify the files you want to track, followed by a <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git commit</code>:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">$ git add *.c
$ git add LICENSE
$ git commit -m 'Initial project version'
</pre>
<p id="p-486">We’ll go over what these commands do in just a minute. At this point, you have a Git repository with tracked files and an initial commit.</p></section><section class="paragraphs" id="_git_cloning"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Cloning an Existing Repository.</span></h4>
<p id="p-487">If you want to get a copy of an existing Git repository — for example, a project you’d like to contribute to — the command you need is <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git clone</code>. If you’re familiar with other VCSs such as Subversion, you’ll notice that the command is "clone" and not "checkout". This is an important distinction — instead of getting just a working copy, Git receives a full copy of nearly all data that the server has. Every version of every file for the history of the project is pulled down by default when you run <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git clone</code>.</p>
<p id="p-488">You clone a repository with <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git clone &lt;url&gt;</code>. For example, if you want to clone the Git linkable library called <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">libgit2</code>, you can do so like this:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">$ git clone https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2
</pre>
<p id="p-489">That creates a directory named <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">libgit2</code>, initializes a <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">.git</code> directory inside it, pulls down all the data for that repository, and checks out a working copy of the latest version. If you go into the new <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">libgit2</code> directory that was just created, you’ll see the project files in there, ready to be worked on or used.</p>
<p id="p-490">If you want to clone the repository into a directory named something other than <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">libgit2</code>, you can specify the new directory name as an additional argument:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">$ git clone https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2 mylibgit
</pre>
<p id="p-491">That command does the same thing as the previous one, but the target directory is called <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">mylibgit</code>.</p>
<p id="p-492">Git has a number of different transfer protocols you can use. The previous example uses the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">https://</code> protocol, but you may also see <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git://</code> or <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">user@server:path/to/repo.git</code>, which uses the SSH transfer protocol.</p></section></section><section class="subsection" id="_recording_changes_to_the_repository"><h3 class="heading hide-type">
<span class="type">Subsection</span> <span class="codenumber">5.3.2</span> <span class="title">Recording Changes to the Repository</span>
</h3>
<p id="p-493">At this point, you should have a <em class="emphasis">bona fide</em> Git repository on your local machine, and a checkout or <em class="emphasis">working copy</em> of all of its files in front of you. Typically, you’ll want to start making changes and committing snapshots of those changes into your repository each time the project reaches a state you want to record.</p>
<p id="p-494">Remember that each file in your working directory can be in one of two states: <em class="emphasis">tracked</em> or <em class="emphasis">untracked</em>. Tracked files are files that were in the last snapshot, as well as any newly staged files; they can be unmodified, modified, or staged. In short, tracked files are files that Git knows about.</p>
<p id="p-495">Untracked files are everything else — any files in your working directory that were not in your last snapshot and are not in your staging area. When you first clone a repository, all of your files will be tracked and unmodified because Git just checked them out and you haven’t edited anything.</p>
<p id="p-496">As you edit files, Git sees them as modified, because you’ve changed them since your last commit. As you work, you selectively stage these modified files and then commit all those staged changes, and the cycle repeats.</p>
<figure class="figure figure-like" id="git-lifecycle"><div class="image-box" style="width: 100%; margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%;"><img src="external/lifecycle.png" class="contained"></div>
<figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">5.3.1<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span>The lifecycle of the status of your files</figcaption></figure><section class="paragraphs" id="_checking_status"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Checking the Status of Your Files.</span></h4>
<p id="p-497">The main tool you use to determine which files are in which state is the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git status</code> command. If you run this command directly after a clone, you should see something like this:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">$ git status
On branch main
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/main'.
nothing to commit, working tree clean
</pre>
<p id="p-498">This means you have a clean working directory; in other words, none of your tracked files are modified. Git also doesn’t see any untracked files, or they would be listed here. Finally, the command tells you which branch you’re on and informs you that it has not diverged from the same branch on the server. That branch is typically <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">main</code>, which is the current default. It could also be <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">master</code>, which was the default until October 1, 2020. Don't worry about it here.  The next section on Git Branching will go over branches and references in detail.</p>
<p id="p-499">Let’s say you add a new file to your project, a simple <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">README</code> file. If the file didn’t exist before, and you run <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git status</code>, you see your untracked file like so:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">$ echo 'My Project' &gt; README
$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Untracked files:
  (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to include in what will be committed)

    README

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
</pre>
<p id="p-500">You can see that your new <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">README</code> file is untracked, because it’s under the “Untracked files” heading in your status output. Untracked basically means that Git sees a file you didn’t have in the previous snapshot (commit), and which hasn’t yet been staged; Git won’t start including it in your commit snapshots until you explicitly tell it to do so. It does this so you don’t accidentally begin including generated binary files or other files that you did not mean to include. You do want to start including <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">README</code>, so let’s start tracking the file.</p></section><section class="paragraphs" id="_tracking_files"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Tracking New Files.</span></h4>
<p id="p-501">In order to begin tracking a new file, you use the command <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git add</code>. To begin tracking the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">README</code> file, you can run this:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">$ git add README
</pre>
<p id="p-502">If you run your status command again, you can see that your <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">README</code> file is now tracked and staged to be committed:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)

    new file:   README
</pre>
<p id="p-503">You can tell that it’s staged because it’s under the “Changes to be committed” heading. If you commit at this point, the version of the file at the time you ran <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git add</code> is what will be in the subsequent historical snapshot. You may recall that when you ran <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git init</code> earlier, you then ran <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git add &lt;files&gt;</code> — that was to begin tracking files in your directory. The <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git add</code> command takes a path name for either a file or a directory; if it’s a directory, the command adds all the files in that directory recursively.</p></section><section class="paragraphs" id="_staging_modified_files"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Staging Modified Files.</span></h4>
<p id="p-504">Let’s change a file that was already tracked. If you change a previously tracked file called <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">CONTRIBUTING.md</code> and then run your <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git status</code> command again, you get something that looks like this:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;..." to discard changes in working directory)

    modified:   CONTRIBUTING.md
</pre>
<p id="p-505">The <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">CONTRIBUTING.md</code> file appears under a section named “Changes not staged for commit” — which means that a file that is tracked has been modified in the working directory but not yet staged. To stage it, you run the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git add</code> command. <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git add</code> is a multipurpose command — you use it to begin tracking new files, to stage files, and to do other things like marking merge-conflicted files as resolved. It may be helpful to think of it more as “add precisely this content to the next commit” rather than “add this file to the project”. Let’s run <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git add</code> now to stage the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">CONTRIBUTING.md</code> file, and then run <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git status</code> again:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">$ git add CONTRIBUTING.md
$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)

    new file:   README
    modified:   CONTRIBUTING.md
</pre>
<p id="p-506">Both files are staged and will go into your next commit. At this point, suppose you remember one little change that you want to make in <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">CONTRIBUTING.md</code> before you commit it. You open it again and make that change, and you’re ready to commit. However, let’s run <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git status</code> one more time:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">$ vim CONTRIBUTING.md
$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;..." to discard changes in working directory)

    modified:   CONTRIBUTING.md
</pre>
<p id="p-507">What the heck? Now <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">CONTRIBUTING.md</code> is listed as both staged <em class="emphasis">and</em> unstaged. How is that possible? It turns out that Git stages a file exactly as it is when you run the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git add</code> command. If you commit now, the version of <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">CONTRIBUTING.md</code> as it was when you last ran the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git add</code> command is how it will go into the commit, not the version of the file as it looks in your working directory when you run <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git commit</code>. If you modify a file after you run <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git add</code>, you have to run <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git add</code> again to stage the latest version of the file:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">$ git add CONTRIBUTING.md
$ git status
On branch master

Changes to be committed:

</pre></section><section class="paragraphs" id="_short_status"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Short Status.</span></h4>
<p id="p-508">While the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git status</code> output is pretty comprehensive, it’s also quite wordy. Git also has a short status flag so you can see your changes in a more compact way. If you run <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git status -s</code> or <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git status --short</code> you get a far more simplified output from the command:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">$ git status -s
 M README
MM Rakefile
A  lib/git.rb
M  lib/simplegit.rb
?? LICENSE.txt
</pre>
<p id="p-509">New files that aren’t tracked have a <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">??</code> next to them, new files that have been added to the staging area have an <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">A</code>, modified files have an <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">M</code> and so on. There are two columns to the output — the left-hand column indicates the status of the staging area and the right-hand column indicates the status of the working tree. So for example in that output, the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">README</code> file is modified in the working directory but not yet staged, while the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">lib/simplegit.rb</code> file is modified and staged. The <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">Rakefile</code> was modified, staged and then modified again, so there are changes to it that are both staged and unstaged.</p></section><section class="paragraphs" id="_ignoring"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Ignoring Files.</span></h4>
<p id="p-510">Often, you’ll have a class of files that you don’t want Git to automatically add or even show you as being untracked. These are generally automatically generated files such as log files or files produced by your build system. In such cases, you can create a file listing patterns to match them named <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">.gitignore</code>. Here is an example <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">.gitignore</code> file:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">$ cat .gitignore
*.[oa]
*~
</pre>
<p id="p-511">The first line tells Git to ignore any files ending in “.o” or “.a” — object and archive files that may be the product of building your code. The second line tells Git to ignore all files whose names end with a tilde (<code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">~</code>), which is used by some text editors  to mark temporary files. You may also include a log, tmp, or pid directory; automatically generated documentation; and so on. Setting up a <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">.gitignore</code> file for your new repository before you get going is generally a good idea so you don’t accidentally commit files that you really don’t want in your Git repository.</p>
<p id="p-512">The rules for the patterns you can put in the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">.gitignore</code> file are as follows:</p>
<ul id="p-513" class="disc">
<li id="li-128"><p id="p-514">Blank lines or lines starting with <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">#</code> are ignored.</p></li>
<li id="li-129"><p id="p-515">Standard glob patterns work, and will be applied recursively throughout the entire working tree.</p></li>
<li id="li-130"><p id="p-516">You can start patterns with a forward slash (<code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">/</code>) to avoid recursivity.</p></li>
<li id="li-131"><p id="p-517">You can end patterns with a forward slash (<code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">/</code>) to specify a directory.</p></li>
<li id="li-132"><p id="p-518">You can negate a pattern by starting it with an exclamation point (<code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">!</code>).</p></li>
</ul>
<p id="p-519">Glob patterns are like simplified regular expressions that shells use. An asterisk (<code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">*</code>) matches zero or more characters; <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">[abc]</code> matches any character inside the brackets (in this case a, b, or c); a question mark (<code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">?</code>) matches a single character; and brackets enclosing characters separated by a hyphen (<code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">[0-9]</code>) matches any character between them (in this case 0 through 9). You can also use two asterisks to match nested directories; <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">a/**/z</code> would match <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">a/z</code>, <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">a/b/z</code>, <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">a/b/c/z</code>, and so on.</p>
<p id="p-520">Here is another example <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">.gitignore</code> file:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore"># ignore all .a files
*.a

# but do track lib.a, even though you're ignoring .a files above
!lib.a

# only ignore the TODO file in the current directory, not subdir/TODO
/TODO

# ignore all files in any directory named build
build/

# ignore doc/notes.txt, but not doc/server/arch.txt
doc/*.txt

# ignore all .pdf files in the doc/ directory and any of its subdirectories
doc/**/*.pdf

<p id="p-522">Note: In the simple case, a repository might have a single <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">.gitignore</code> file in its root directory, which applies recursively to the entire repository. However, it is also possible to have additional <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">.gitignore</code> files in subdirectories.

<p id="p-524">If the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git status</code> command is too vague for you — you want to know exactly what you changed, not just which files were changed — you can use the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git diff</code> command. We’ll cover <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git diff</code> in more detail later, but you’ll probably use it most often to answer these two questions: What have you changed but not yet staged?

<p id="p-553">You can pass files, directories, and file-glob patterns to the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git rm</code> command. That means you can do things such as:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">$ git rm log/\*.log
</pre>
<p id="p-554">Note the backslash (<code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">\</code>) in front of the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">*</code>. This is necessary because Git does its own filename expansion in addition to your shell’s filename expansion. This command removes all files that have the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">.log</code> extension in the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">log/</code> directory. Or, you can do something like this:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">$ git rm \*~
</pre>
<p id="p-555">This command removes all files whose names end with a <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">~</code>.</p></section><section class="paragraphs" id="_git_mv"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Moving Files.</span></h4>
<p id="p-556">Unlike many other VCSs, Git doesn’t explicitly track file movement. If you rename a file in Git, no metadata is stored in Git that tells it you renamed the file. However, Git is pretty smart about figuring that out after the fact — we’ll deal with detecting file movement a bit later.</p>
<p id="p-557">Thus it’s a bit confusing that Git has a <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">mv</code> command. If you want to rename a file in Git, you can run something like:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">$ git mv file_from file_to
</pre>
<p id="p-558">and it works fine. In fact, if you run something like this and look at the status, you’ll see that Git considers it a renamed file:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">$ git mv README.md README
$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)

    renamed:    README.md -&gt; README
</pre>
<p id="p-559">However, this is equivalent to running something like this:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">$ mv README.md README
$ git rm README.md
$ git add README
</pre>
<p id="p-560">Git figures out that it’s a rename implicitly, so it doesn’t matter if you rename a file that way or with the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">mv</code> command. The only real difference is that <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git mv</code> is one command instead of three — it’s a convenience function. More importantly, you can use any tool you like to rename a file, and address the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">add</code>/<code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">rm</code> later, before you commit.</p></section></section><section class="subsection" id="_viewing_history"><h3 class="heading hide-type">

<span class="type">Subsection</span> <span class="codenumber">5.3.4</span> <span class="title">Undoing Changes</span>
</h3>
<p id="p-569">At any stage, you may want to undo something. Here, we’ll review a few basic tools for undoing changes that you’ve made. Be careful, because you can’t always undo some of these undos. This is one of the few areas in Git where you may lose some work if you do it wrong.</p>
<p id="p-570">One of the common undos takes place when you commit too early and possibly forget to add some files, or you mess up your commit message. If you want to redo that commit, make the additional changes you forgot, stage them, and commit again using the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">--amend</code> option:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">$ git commit --amend
</pre>
<p id="p-571">This command takes your staging area and uses it for the commit. If you’ve made no changes since your last commit (for instance, you run this command immediately after your previous commit), then your snapshot will look exactly the same, and all you’ll change is your commit message.</p>
<p id="p-572">The same commit-message editor fires up, but it already contains the message of your previous commit. You can edit the message the same as always, but it overwrites your previous commit.</p>
<p id="p-573">As an example, if you commit and then realize you forgot to stage the changes in a file you wanted to add to this commit, you can do something like this:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">$ git commit -m 'Initial commit'
$ git add forgotten_file
$ git commit --amend
</pre>
<p id="p-574">You end up with a single commit — the second commit replaces the results of the first.</p>
<p id="p-575">Note: It’s important to understand that when you’re amending your last commit, you’re not so much fixing it as <em class="emphasis">replacing</em> it entirely with a new, improved commit that pushes the old commit out of the way and puts the new commit in its place. Effectively, it’s as if the previous commit never happened, and it won’t show up in your repository history.</p>
<p id="p-576">The obvious value to amending commits is to make minor improvements to your last commit, without cluttering your repository history with commit messages of the form, “Oops, forgot to add a file” or “Darn, fixing a typo in last commit”.</p>
<p id="p-577">Note: Only amend commits that are still local and have not been pushed somewhere. Amending previously pushed commits and force pushing the branch will cause problems for your collaborators. </p>
<section class="paragraphs" id="_unstaging"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Unstaging a Staged File.</span></h4>
<p id="p-578">The next two sections demonstrate how to work with your staging area and working directory changes. The nice part is that the command you use to determine the state of those two areas also reminds you how to undo changes to them. For example, let’s say you’ve changed two files and want to commit them as two separate changes, but you accidentally type <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git add *</code> and stage them both. How can you unstage one of the two? The <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git status</code> command reminds you:</p>

</h3>
<p id="p-597">To be able to collaborate on any Git project, you need to know how to manage your remote repositories. Remote repositories are versions of your project that are hosted on the Internet or network somewhere. You can have several of them, each of which generally is either read-only or read/write for you. Collaborating with others involves managing these remote repositories and pushing and pulling data to and from them when you need to share work. Managing remote repositories includes knowing how to add remote repositories, remove remotes that are no longer valid, manage various remote branches and define them as being tracked or not, and more. In this section, we’ll cover some of these remote-management skills.</p>
<p id="p-598"><em class="emphasis">Remote repositories can be on your local machine.</em> It is entirely possible that you can be working with a “remote” repository that is, in fact, on the same host you are. The word “remote” does not necessarily imply that the repository is somewhere else on the network or Internet, only that it is elsewhere. Working with such a remote repository would still involve all the standard pushing, pulling and fetching operations as with any other remote.</p>
<section class="paragraphs" id="_showing_your_remotes"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Showing Your Remotes.</span></h4>
<p id="p-599">To see which remote servers you have configured, you can run the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git remote</code> command. It lists the shortnames of each remote handle you’ve specified. If you’ve cloned your repository, you should at least see <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">origin</code> — that is the default name Git gives to the server you cloned from:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">$ git clone https://github.com/schacon/ticgit

$ cd ticgit
$ git remote

</pre>
<p id="p-600">You can also specify <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">-v</code>, which shows you the URLs that Git has stored for the shortname to be used when reading and writing to that remote:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">$ git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/schacon/ticgit (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/schacon/ticgit (push)
</pre>
<p id="p-601">If you have more than one remote, the command lists them all. For example, a repository with multiple remotes for working with several collaborators might look something like this.</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">$ cd grit
$ git remote -v

<p id="p-602">This means we can pull contributions from any of these users pretty easily.

<p id="p-603">We’ve mentioned and given some demonstrations of how the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git clone</code> command implicitly adds the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">origin</code> remote for you. Here’s how to add a new remote explicitly. To add a new remote Git repository as a shortname you can reference easily, run <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git remote add &lt;shortname&gt; &lt;url&gt;</code>:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">$ git remote

$ git remote add pb https://github.com/paulboone/ticgit

pb  https://github.com/paulboone/ticgit (fetch)
pb  https://github.com/paulboone/ticgit (push)
</pre>
<p id="p-604">Now you can use the string <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">pb</code> on the command line in lieu of the whole URL. For example, if you want to fetch all the information that Paul has but that you don’t yet have in your repository, you can run <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git fetch pb</code>:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">$ git fetch pb

<p id="p-605">Paul’s <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">master</code> branch is now accessible locally as <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">pb/master</code> — you can merge it into one of your branches, or you can check out a local branch at that point if you want to inspect it. We’ll go over what branches are and how to use them in much more detail in the next subsection on Git Branching.</p></section><section class="paragraphs" id="_fetching_and_pulling"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Fetching and Pulling from Your Remotes.</span></h4>
<p id="p-606">As you just saw, to get data from your remote projects, you can run:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">$ git fetch &lt;remote&gt;
</pre>
<p id="p-607">The command goes out to that remote project and pulls down all the data from that remote project that you don’t have yet. After you do this, you should have references to all the branches from that remote, which you can merge in or inspect at any time.</p>
<p id="p-608">If you clone a repository, the command automatically adds that remote repository under the name “origin”. So, <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git fetch origin</code> fetches any new work that has been pushed to that server since you cloned (or last fetched from) it. It’s important to note that the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git fetch</code> command only downloads the data to your local repository — it doesn’t automatically merge it with any of your work or modify what you’re currently working on. You have to merge it manually into your work when you’re ready.</p>
<p id="p-609">If your current branch is set up to track a remote branch (see the next section on Git Branching for more information), you can use the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git pull</code> command to automatically fetch and then merge that remote branch into your current branch. This may be an easier or more comfortable workflow for you; and by default, the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git clone</code> command automatically sets up your local <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">master</code> branch to track the remote <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">master</code> branch (or whatever the default branch is called) on the server you cloned from. Running <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git pull</code> generally fetches data from the server you originally cloned from and automatically tries to merge it into the code you’re currently working on.</p>
<p id="p-610">Note: From git version 2.27 onward, <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git pull</code> will give a warning if the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">pull.rebase</code> variable is not set. Git will keep warning you until you set the variable.</p>
<p id="p-611">If you want the default behavior of git (fast-forward if possible, else create a merge commit): <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git config --global pull.rebase "false"</code></p>
<p id="p-612">If you want to rebase when pulling: <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git config --global pull.rebase "true"</code></p></section><section class="paragraphs" id="_pushing_remotes"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Pushing to Your Remotes.</span></h4>
<p id="p-613">When you have your project at a point that you want to share, you have to push it upstream. The command for this is simple: <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git push &lt;remote&gt; &lt;branch&gt;</code>. If you want to push your <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">master</code> branch to your <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">origin</code> server (again, cloning generally sets up both of those names for you automatically), then you can run this to push any commits you’ve done back up to the server:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">$ git push origin master
</pre>
<p id="p-614">This command works only if you cloned from a server to which you have write access and if nobody has pushed in the meantime. If you and someone else clone at the same time and they push upstream and then you push upstream, your push will rightly be rejected. You’ll have to fetch their work first and incorporate it into yours before you’ll be allowed to push. See the next section on Git Branching for more detailed information on how to push to remote servers.</p></section></section><section class="conclusion" id="conclusion-8"><h3 class="heading">Section Summary.<span></span>

<p id="p-615">At this point, you can do all the basic local Git operations — creating or cloning a repository, making changes, staging and committing those changes, and viewing the history of all the changes the repository has been through. Next, we’ll cover Git’s killer feature: its branching model.</p></section></section><div class="hidden-content tex2jax_ignore" id="hk-fn-142"><div class="fn"><code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">github.com/github/gitignore</code></div></div>
