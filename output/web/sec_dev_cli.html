<span class="type">Section</span> <span class="codenumber">1.1</span> <span class="title">Terminals and Other Terms</span>
</h2>
<section class="introduction" id="introduction-2"><p id="p-37">In this section, we explain some terminology, explore why developers use the command line, and then we get a bit of practice using the command line. If you have worked on the command line before, then this entire section may serve as a review. If you have never worked on the command line, then this section is written with you in mind.</p>
<ul id="p-38" class="disc">
<li id="li-1">
<span class="heading"><span class="title">What is a <dfn class="terminology">terminal</dfn>?</span></span><p id="p-39">The English word <dfn class="terminology">terminal</dfn> means to be situated at the end of something. In computing, a terminal is situated at the user end of a computer and is a program used for entering information into and receiving information from a computer.</p>
</li>
<li id="li-2">
<span class="heading"><span class="title">What is a <dfn class="terminology">console</dfn>?</span></span><p id="p-40">The English word <dfn class="terminology">console</dfn> comes from the related verb, <em class="emphasis">to console</em>, which means to provide support. In computing, the original meaning of the <dfn class="terminology">console</dfn> was as a physical device that supported input into and output from a computer. The term is still used that way, but it has also come to be synonymous with terminal in some environments. For example, if you search for console on a Windows machine, you may find the terminal program and/or you may find a security console program.</p>
</li>
<li id="li-3">
<span class="heading"><span class="title">What is a <dfn class="terminology">Command Line Interface (CLI)</dfn>?</span></span><p id="p-41">A <dfn class="terminology">CLI</dfn> is any type of interface that is used to enter text-based commands. We will use a specialized CLI.</p>
</li>
<li id="li-4">
<span class="heading"><span class="title">What is a <dfn class="terminology">shell</dfn>?</span></span><p id="p-42">A <dfn class="terminology">shell</dfn> is a specialized program which parses and interprets the commands you enter in the terminal and then asks the operating system to execute them. In other words, a shell is a highly specialized CLI which serves as the interface between the end-user and the operating system. It is called a shell because it is the user interface or the outermost layer "around" the <dfn class="terminology">kernel</dfn> which is the innermost part of the operating system.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="continuation">Although these terms are distinct from one another as described above, you will often hear people use the terms terminal, CLI, console, and shell almost interchangeably. Don't let it worry you too much because you should almost always be able to understand what is meant from the context.</p>
<p id="p-43">Given that the Graphical User Interface (GUI) came into widespread use decades ago, it may seem surprising that nearly all software developers utilize a non-graphical shell. The primary reasons for this include:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li id="li-5">
<span class="heading"><span class="title">Power.</span></span><p id="p-44">The shell facilitates features that are unavailable or difficult to access in a GUI. The mouse only allows for picking among the small set of predetermined options from the screen. However, for most systems many more options are actually available. In addition, most operating systems  prevent you from performing certain tasks which are system protected unless you are using the shell.</p>
</li>
<li id="li-6">
<span class="heading"><span class="title">Speed.</span></span><p id="p-45">The shell facilitates all commands at the speed one can type them, which is typically many times faster than commands can typically be selected from a menu. In addition, GUIs utilize many more resources than simple text, so even for a slow typist, the shell is faster.</p>
</li>
<li id="li-7">
<span class="heading"><span class="title">Automation.</span></span><p id="p-46">If you need to do something that is repetitive or requires combining multiple commands, the shell facilitates this too. For example, it would be hard to a GUI to find all files that contain a particular pattern and then perform some operation on all of them, but this is easy with a shell program.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="p-47">Disclaimer: Because the shell is both feature-rich and powerful, it is way beyond the scope of this book to cover anything but the bare necessities of a popular shell, so the subsections below cover only the essentials from accessing the shell to issuing essential commands.</p></section><section class="subsection" id="subsec_os"><h3 class="heading hide-type">
<span class="type">Subsection</span> <span class="codenumber">1.1.1</span> <span class="title">Accessing a Terminal</span>
</h3>
<p id="p-48">One question you might have is whether you can use your existing machine to contribute to open source. The good news is that whether you are using Mac OS, Linux, or Windows you should be able to set up a development environment, open a terminal, and access an appropriate shell.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li id="li-8">
<span class="heading"><span class="title">On a Mac.</span></span><p id="p-49">If you are on a Mac, you will need to run the <em class="emphasis">Terminal</em> program to access a shell.  Opening the Terminal on a Mac works like opening any other program: you can find it in the Applications folder, you can search for it, you can use the Launchpad, or you can use it's shortcut which is command(⌘)+T.</p>
</li>
<li id="li-9">
<span class="heading"><span class="title">In Linux.</span></span><p id="p-50">In Linux, the terminal is also called the <em class="emphasis">Terminal</em>. You can access it in several ways: search for the keyword Terminal, right-click  on your desktop and then select "Open Terminal", or use the shortcut Ctrl+Alt+T.</p>
</li>
<li id="li-10">
<span class="heading"><span class="title">In Windows.</span></span><p id="p-51">If you are on a Windows machine, getting to an appropriate shell is a bit more complicated. While one can use PowerShell, it is not the typical way to develop in Windows, and technical differences are likely to cause you headaches. The recommended way to develop in Windows is to use a Linux shell. If you are running Windows 11 or Windows 10 version 2004 or higher, then following the directions from Microsoft on <a class="external" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install" target="_blank">Installing Linux on Windows with WSL2</a><a href="" data-knowl="" class="id-ref fn-knowl original" data-refid="hk-fn-19" id="fn-19"><sup> 1 </sup></a> will give you the best experience. Note that you may first need to update your Windows OS, see <a class="external" href="https://bit.ly/Windows-Update-FAQ" target="_blank"><code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">https://bit.ly/Windows-Update-FAQ</code></a>. WSL2 provides a full Linux kernel that is integrated into the Windows operating system. Installing <a class="external" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/install" target="_blank">the Windows Terminal</a><a href="" data-knowl="" class="id-ref fn-knowl original" data-refid="hk-fn-20" id="fn-20"><sup> 2 </sup></a> will further enhance your experience, although it is not strictly necessary. Once you have followed the linked directions to install WSL2, including the installation of Linux (Ubuntu is a good choice),  then the shell is most easily accessed by searching for Ubuntu in the search tool next to the Windows Icon and selecting it when you see it. For convenience, consider right-clicking on the Ubuntu icon and pinning it to your Start menu or to your Taskbar.</p>
<p id="p-52">If you are running an earlier version of Windows and cannot upgrade to Windows 10 version 2004 or higher, then using a Virtual Machine (VM) environment such as <a class="external" href="https://www.virtualbox.org/" target="_blank">Virtual Box</a><a href="" data-knowl="" class="id-ref fn-knowl original" data-refid="hk-fn-21" id="fn-21"><sup> 3 </sup></a> and installing and running Ubuntu inside the VM is highly advisable.</p>
</li>
<li id="li-11">
<span class="heading"><span class="title">Another OS.</span></span><p id="p-53">Although Linux, Mac, and Windows (to a lesser extent) are by far the most typical development environments, developing in another OS environment might also be possible. For example, searching the Internet on "software development in ChromeOS" will provide several useful links for how to set up a development environment in ChromeOS. Just be aware that developing in an OS environment other than Linux, Mac, or a modern version of Windows is likely to offer little in the way of support, so you might be better off using a Virtual Machine (VM) environment such as <a class="external" href="https://www.virtualbox.org/" target="_blank">Virtual Box</a><a href="" data-knowl="" class="id-ref fn-knowl original" data-refid="hk-fn-22" id="fn-22"><sup> 4 </sup></a> and installing and running Ubuntu in the VM.</p>
</li>
<li id="li-12">
<span class="heading"><span class="title">In the Cloud.</span></span><p id="p-54">To contribute to most open source projects, you will need to set-up a build environment for local testing. White it is typical to install this on a local machine, it can be done in the cloud for a small monthly fee. More about this later. For the purposes of this chapter, if you cannot quickly set up your local environment, you can practice using a shell at Fabrice Bellard's <a class="external" href="https://bellard.org/jslinux/" target="_blank">JSLinux</a><a href="" data-knowl="" class="id-ref fn-knowl original" data-refid="hk-fn-23" id="fn-23"><sup> 5 </sup></a> which provides a very small cloud-based virtual machine environment. (Choosing the riscv64 Linux console will work for all of these exercises.) Note that this a free service which has a capped bandwidth of 40 kB/s. You are asked to please be respectful and don't abuse the service.</p>

<p id="p-55">There are many shells available for Linux, but the most popular is the Bourne-again shell (<dfn class="terminology">bash</dfn>) shell, so this section is focused on bash. If you are using another shell like the <dfn class="terminology">zsh</dfn> shell, which is newer (and also the default shell in modern MacOS), don't worry because there is a very large amount of overlap. Even so, if you wish to change your default shell, you can easily do so as follows:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li id="li-13">
<span class="heading"><span class="title">On a Mac.</span></span><p id="p-56">In the Terminal app, choose Terminal &gt; Settings, then click General. Next to “shells open with," select "Command", then "complete the path" and enter the complete path to the shell you want to use.</p>
</li>
<li id="li-14">
<span class="heading"><span class="title">On Linux or Windows WSL2 Ubuntu.</span></span><p id="p-57">The bash shell is the default, but in case you want to change it, you can use chsh to change the shell to another shell.</p>

</h4></a></article><div class="hidden-content tex2jax_ignore" id="hk-exercise-try-cli"><article class="exercise exercise-like"><p id="p-59">Try each of the following commands on your own machine.</p></article></div>
<p id="p-60">First, follow the directions given in <a href="sec_dev_cli.html#subsec_os" class="internal" title="Subsection 1.1.1: Accessing a Terminal">Subsection 1.1.1</a> to open a terminal window so you can use your shell. All of the shell commands will be typed in this terminal window.</p>
<p id="p-61">Linux is designed as a multi-user system,so there are users. If you type the following shell command:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">whoami
</pre>
<p id="p-62">The shell should respond with the username that you created when you set up your system.  For me that is <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">pearcej</code>.</p>
<section class="paragraphs" id="paragraphs-4"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Directories.</span></h4>
<p id="p-63"></p>
<p id="p-64">In a GUI, we are used to using folders to navigate the file system. There are two useful metaphors or mental models to help with our understanding. Note that when using the shell, these "folders" are more typically called <dfn class="terminology">directories</dfn>, but using the "folder" as your mental model for a directory will be very effective. This mental model tells us that inside of a directory, we can find files and possibly additional directories. Technically speaking, a directory is actually just a file that contains a list of other files, so you will see the both files and directories presented similarly by the shell. Using a different metaphor, you can think of all of the directories in your entire system as forming a tree structure which grows downward from a single directory which is known as the <dfn class="terminology">root directory</dfn>. In other words, the top level directory which is the parent of all directories is called the 'root' directory. It is referenced by the use of forward slash symbol (<dfn class="terminology">/</dfn>) when the forward slash symbol is used alone (or at least with nothing prepended in front of it). (As a comparison, the root directory notation in a standard Windows sset-up is the C: directory.) </p>
<p id="p-65">First, let's get our bearings and see which directory we are currently in. The <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">pwd</code> command stands for <em class="emphasis">print working directory</em> and as the name says it prints the name of the directory you are working in. Try typing:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">pwd
</pre>
<p id="p-66">When I  type this, I see the following:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">/home/pearcej
</pre>
<p id="p-67">Reading from right to left, this means I am in a <dfn class="terminology">child</dfn> directory named <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">pearcej</code> which itself is a child of a directory called <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">home</code> which is itself a child of the root directory. If you prefer the folder metaphor to the tree metaphor, you can think of <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">pearcej</code> as being "inside" of the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">home</code> directory, which is inside of the root directory. Note that position with respect to the forward slash '/' tells us the direction of the relationship – further to the right is further "inside".</p>
<p id="p-68">Let's try "moving" (i.e. changing our working directory) to the root directory. Use the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">cd</code> command which stands for <em class="emphasis">change directory</em> followed by the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">/</code> by typing:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">cd /
</pre>
<p id="p-69">What you just did should have transported you to the <dfn class="terminology">root directory</dfn> (if you weren't there already.) Note that the term <em class="emphasis">root directory</em> shouldn't be confused with the term <em class="emphasis">root user</em> in a Linux-like system. The <dfn class="terminology">root user</dfn> is a user named <em class="emphasis">root</em>, which is a special superuser account in Linux operating systems that has unrestricted read and write privileges to everything. The <em class="emphasis">root directory</em> should also not be confused with the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">/root</code> folder which found on some Linux-based OS's, which is the home directory of the root superuser.</p>
<p id="p-70">Next type the following <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">ls</code> to get a <em class="emphasis">listing</em> of the files and subdirectories in the <em class="emphasis">root directory</em>.</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">ls
</pre>
<p id="p-71">Many shell commands have options which can be invoked by using a <dfn class="terminology">flag</dfn> or <dfn class="terminology">command option</dfn>. Try typing the following where the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">-r</code> flag stands for <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">reverse</code>, and it reverses the sorting order:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">ls -r
</pre>
<p id="p-72">To try another, try typing the following where the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">-l</code> option stands for <em class="emphasis">long listing format</em>, meaning that instead of output containing only a names of files and directories the ls command will produce additional information, assuming you have at least one file or directory.</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">ls -l
</pre>
<p id="p-73">You are likely to see some lines that look something like this:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">drwxr-xr-x  3 root    root     4096 Jun 19 10:55 home

<p id="p-75">Let's explore the permissions portions of the lines produced by the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">ls -l</code> command. The last item on each of these lines is the filename itself. The first item in each of the lines is a 10 character-long mix of letters and minus signs. The first character of that set indicates the file type where <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">d</code> tells us it is a directory, <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">l</code> indicates it is a symbolic link, and <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">-</code> indicates it is a regular file. The next nine characters display various permissions for the file. The first set of three characters (characters 2-4) are the user's (i.e. the file owner's) permissions, the next three are the group's permissions, and the last three are the permissions for all others. (The user's name  is in the third column and the group name is in the fourth column.) In each of these sets of three characters, the three characters refer to read (<code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">r</code>), write (<code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">w</code>), and execute (<code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">x</code>) respectively. If you see a letter then that permission is allowed, and if you see a '-', the permission is disallowed. For example in the last of the three lines shown above, we see that the file <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">hello.txt</code> has permissions of <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">-rw-rw-r--</code>. This means this is a file that can be read and written (changed) but not executed by the owner <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">pearcej</code> and also by any user who is a member of the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">friends</code> group, however other users can only read the file.</p></section><section class="paragraphs" id="paragraphs-6"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Shell Command Options.</span></h4>
<p id="p-76"></p>
<p id="p-77">If you want to see all of the flag options there are two different methods for most commands. You can use the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">--help</code> flag option on the command or you can use the <dfn class="terminology">manual</dfn> which is accessed using the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">man</code> command. For example, with the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">ls</code> command, you can use either one of the following, noting that they work a bit differently because the manual may use paging. If it does, to go to the next page use the space bar.</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">ls --help
man ls
</pre>
<p id="p-78">You may be wondering about the use of one minus sign '-' vs the use of two minus signs '--' in shell flags. One is used for single letter commands, while two is used for word-length commands. If you look back at the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">ls --help</code> results, you may see that the flags <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">-a</code> and <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">--all</code> both list all files including that begin with a '.', which are the hidden files  and directories. Besides brevity, the main advantage to the single minus sign is that to run multiple options at the same time, all you need to do is concatenate them, so <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">ls -lra</code> would return the result with  the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">-l</code>,  <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">-r</code>, and <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">a</code> option flags all activated. Give it a try!</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">ls -lra

<p id="p-80">Next, let's go to your <dfn class="terminology">home</dfn> directory which is referenced by the special tilde '~' character as follows: </p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">cd ~
</pre>
<p id="p-81">Then list your files just to see that you have been transported again.</p>
<p id="p-82">You can make a new directory using the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">mkdir</code> command. For example, let's say you want to make a new directory with the name <em class="emphasis">newdir</em>, you can type the following:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">mkdir newdir
</pre>
<p id="p-83">If you get a listing of your files and directories with <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">ls -l</code>, you should see something like the following:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">drwxr-xr-x  2 pearcej pearcej   4096 Nov 15 17:00 newdir
</pre>
<p id="p-84">Then you can descend into the new directory with:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">cd newdir
</pre>
<p id="p-85">Of course if you now run the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">ls</code> command, you will not see any files, but try it with the following options:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">ls -la
</pre>
<p id="p-86">You are likely to see something like the following:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">drwxr-xr-x  2 pearcej pearcej 4096 Nov 26 17:00 .
drwxr-xr-x 13 pearcej pearcej 4096 Nov 26 17:00 ..
</pre>
<p id="p-87">Note the period at the end of the first line where the filename is expected. A period or dot '.' represents the current directory. The double period or double dot '..' represents the parent directory of the current one. </p>
<p id="p-88">You can use this dot notation as a reference as well, so <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">ls ..</code>, will list all the files and directories in the parent directory relative to where you are so you don't have to change directories to get the listing from another directory. Try it!</p>
<p id="p-89">You can even use these dots in combination ether with folder names. If you then type:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">ls -la
</pre></section><p id="p-90">When you are done working for a bit, you should logout.
