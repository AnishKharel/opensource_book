<p>Communities come in all shapes and sizes, and more than one community might be pertinent. For example,you must keep in mind the rules of your company if you work for one. The examples above are very well established. If the community you’re building a project for doesn’t have set-in-stone licensing traditions, or you don’t see your project as part of any particular community, that’s fine. Then you will need to make your own choice of a license because not posting any license at all means you implicitly retain all rights and give no permissions to use, share, modify, or improve the software.</p>
