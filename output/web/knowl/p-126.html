<p>If you are used to being part of a dominant culture, joining a new culture may be an unfamiliar experience, but the best advice is similar to the advice given to anyone traveling to a different part of the world:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">Open-mindedness.</span></span><p> Remember that you are new to the culture, so keep an open mind and pay attention to the interactions of those who are more experienced in the culture. Note both the differences from and the similarities with your expectations, but try not to react to them before you reflect on them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">Gratitude.</span></span><p> Even if your intentions are good, you are likely to need help learning the culture and the cultural expectations. If people try to help you, be sure to express your gratitude!</p>
</li>
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">Attentiveness.</span></span><p> Try to understand the culture by doing your homework. Read the materials designed to help novices including not just the README and the contribution guide, but also the interactions on the various communication channels, bug reports, etc.</p>
</li>
</ul>
