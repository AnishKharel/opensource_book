<section class="paragraphs"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Centralized VCSs.</span></h4> <div class="para"></div> <div class="para">Many developers need to collaborate with other developers on other systems. To deal with this, centralized VCss) were developed. These systems (such as CVS, Subversion, and Perforce) have a single server that contains all the versioned files, and a number of clients check out files from that central server. For many years, this was the standard for version control.</div> <div class="para">Centralized VCSs offer many advantages local VCSs. For example, everyone knows or can see to a certain degree what everyone else on the project is doing. Administrators have fine-grained control over who can do what.</div> <div class="para">However, centralized VCSs also have some serious downsides. Conflict resolution can be a challenge because if individual copies of the repository diverge significantly from one another, conflicts can arise when merging changes is attempted. This lead to a process of resolving the conflicts, which can be time-consuming even when using conflict resolution tools. In fact, resolution of conflicts can delay the development process. To mitigate this, developers must communicate regarding direction and must also synchronize copies of the codebase regularly by merging changes  often. Effective communication and frequent updating can help prevent significant divergence and reduce the risk of conflicts in centralized VCSs.</div> <div class="para">Another obvious is that like local VCSs, the centralized server represents a single point of failure. If that server goes down for an time, then during that downtime nobody can collaborate at all and no one can save versioned changes to anything they’re working on. If the disk of the central server becomes corrupted, and proper backups haven’t been kept, the project could lose absolutely everything — the entire history of the project except whatever single snapshots people happen to have on their local machines.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_git_getting_started.html#sec_centralized_version_control_systems" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
