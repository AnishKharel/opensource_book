<p>When you have your project at a point that you want to share, you have to push it upstream. The command for this is simple: <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git push &lt;remote&gt; &lt;branch&gt;</code>. If you want to push your <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">master</code> branch to your <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">origin</code> server (again, cloning generally sets up both of those names for you automatically), then you can run this to push any commits you’ve done back up to the server:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">$ git push origin master
</pre>
<p>This command works only if you cloned from a server to which you have write access and if nobody has pushed in the meantime. If you and someone else clone at the same time and they push upstream and then you push upstream, your push will rightly be rejected. You’ll have to fetch their work first and incorporate it into yours before you’ll be allowed to push. See the next section on Git Branching for more detailed information on how to push to remote servers.</p></section><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_git_basics.html#_pushing_remotes" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
