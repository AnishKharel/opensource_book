<p>Because of the open nature of the source code, many credible organizations believe that OSS is at least comparable to proprietary software in the area of software security. And, security in nearly every type of software matters to some extent, often to a critical extent. A user of proprietary software must accept the level of security (as well as the lack there of) that the software vendor is able and willing to provide as well as the speed at which fixes and updates to the software are released. If the user is not willing to accept these limitations, they must simply choose a different vender. Hence, some organizations such as the <a class="external" href="https://dodcio.defense.gov/Open-Source-Software-FAQ/" target="_blank">US Department of Defense</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-15-hidden.html" title="Footnote 1.2.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a>  require that all software either have a warranty or be open source. So, open source matters for reasons of security.</p>
