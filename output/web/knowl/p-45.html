<p>Without FOSS, getting experience in real software projects requires access, and probably permission, to see the source code. For students, that access is usually limited to those who can get <em class="emphasis">internships</em> or positions in <em class="emphasis">co-op </em>programs. Not everyone has the opportunity to spend the summer interning with a company that does large-scale software development, meaning that a vanishingly small number of students have the opportunity to work with large (closed) codebases. And even if they do, those students typically cannot show their work to anyone outside of the sponsoring company.</p>
