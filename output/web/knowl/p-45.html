<li><p>First, search the web and <dfn class="terminology">find sites that host FOSS projects</dfn>. There are many. Bookmark these so that you can come back to them later.</p></li>
<li><p>Second, <dfn class="terminology">browse through several of these sites</dfn> and find one or more projects that are interesting to you. You might be interested in projects that benefit others. You might be interested in tools that support work that you do. Or, it might be that you might find something strikes your fancy that you never considered before! Take this as an opportunity to explore broadly.</p></li>
<li><p>After you find a project, <dfn class="terminology">write a blog post about it</dfn>. At this point, the most important thing you can probably do is to explain why the project is interesting to you.</p></li>
