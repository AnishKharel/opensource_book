<p>A <dfn class="terminology">file</dfn> is just a container for storing information. On a phone or in a GUI, we see typically see files as icons with the filename below or to the right. We might (or might not) be used to using folders to organize our files and to navigate the file system. (On an Iphone or Android phone, you make a new folder by dropping one app on top of another app, on a Mac you long press and then choose new folder, and on a Windows machine, you right-click and choose New &gt; folder.) This type of organization is important to understand, and the folder metaphor is useful. In fact, there are two useful metaphors or mental models to help with our understanding of file systems. Note that when using the shell, these "folders" are more typically called <dfn class="terminology">directories</dfn>, but using the "folder" as your mental model for a directory will be very effective. This mental model tells us that inside of a directory, we can find files and possibly additional directories. Technically speaking, a directory is actually just a file that contains a list of other files, so you will see the both files and directories presented similarly by the shell. Using a different metaphor, you can think of all of the directories in your entire system as forming a tree structure which grows downward from a single directory which is known as the <dfn class="terminology">root directory</dfn>. In other words, the top level directory which is the parent of all directories is called the 'root' directory. It is referenced by the use of forward slash symbol (<dfn class="terminology">/</dfn>) when the forward slash symbol is used alone (or at least with nothing prepended in front of it). (As a comparison, the root directory notation in a standard Windows set-up is the C: directory.) </p>
