<div class="para">During ordinary use of Git, nearly all of your actions only add data. It is intended to be hard to get Git to do anything that is not undoable or to make it erase data in any way. As with any VCS, you can lose or mess up changes you havenâ€™t committed yet, but after you commit a snapshot into Git, it is more difficult to lose, specially if you regularly push the state of your repository to a remote. Having said this, novices can get themselves into a mess. Some advice is to always make sure you are working on a branch <em class="emphasis">other than main or master</em>, and always check to be sure you are on the intended branch before you begin working.</div>
