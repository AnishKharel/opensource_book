<p>As we covered in <a class="external" href="ch00/ch06-github_flow" target="_blank">The GitHub Flow</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-139-hidden.html" title="Footnote 6.4.35"><sup> 35 </sup></a>, you can now have a conversation with the person who opened the Pull Request. You can comment on specific lines of code, comment on whole commits or comment on the entire Pull Request itself, using GitHub Flavored Markdown everywhere.</p>
<p>Every time someone else comments on the Pull Request you will continue to get email notifications so you know there is activity happening. They will each have a link to the Pull Request where the activity is happening and you can also directly respond to the email to comment on the Pull Request thread.</p>

<p>If the merge is trivial, you can also just hit the “Merge” button on the GitHub site. This will do a “non-fast-forward” merge, creating a merge commit even if a fast-forward merge was possible. This means that no matter what, every time you hit the merge button, a merge commit is created. As you can see in <a class="external" href="ch00/_merge_button" target="_blank">Merge button and instructions for merging a Pull Request manually</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-140-hidden.html" title="Footnote 6.4.36"><sup> 36 </sup></a>, GitHub gives you all of this information if you click the hint link.</p>
