<p>As we covered above, you can now have a conversation with the person who opened the Pull Request. You can comment on specific lines of code, comment on whole commits or comment on the entire Pull Request itself, using GitHub Flavored Markdown everywhere.</p>
<p>Every time someone else comments on the Pull Request you will continue to get email notifications so you know there is activity happening. They will each have a link to the Pull Request where the activity is happening and you can also directly respond to the email to comment on the Pull Request thread.</p>
<p>Once the code is in a place you like and want to merge it in, you can either pull the code down and merge it locally, either with the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git pull &lt;url&gt; &lt;branch&gt;</code> syntax we saw earlier, or by adding the fork as a remote and fetching and merging.</p>
<p>If the merge is trivial, you can also just hit the “Merge” button on the GitHub site. This will do a “non-fast-forward” merge, creating a merge commit even if a fast-forward merge was possible. This means that no matter what, every time you hit the merge button, a merge commit is created. As you can see in <a class="external" href="ch00/_merge_button" target="_blank">Merge button and instructions for merging a Pull Request manually</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-156-hidden.html" title="Footnote 5.6.14"><sup> 14 </sup></a>, GitHub gives you all of this information if you click the hint link.</p>
<p>If you decide you don’t want to merge it, you can also just close the Pull Request and the person who opened it will be notified.</p></section><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_git_github.html#_collaborating_on_the_pull_request" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
