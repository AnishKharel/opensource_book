<p>What do you think of when you think of documentation in OSS? Do you think of the README or LICENSE or CODE_OF_CONDUCT or other files often found in the root of the main code repository? Do you think of source code documentation? Do you think of documentation made by documentation generators such as Doxygen, Javadoc, NDoc, or others? Do you think of tutorials or user manuals? Do you think of the list of open merge requests and related discussions for a project? Do you think of release notes or other documentation accompanying specific versions of the software? If you think of these, then you are on the right track, but documentation in a typical OSS project often includes even more.</p>
