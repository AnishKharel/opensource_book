<p>The Command Line Interface (CLI) is a text-based programming language that can be used to control a computer using a language known as a <dfn class="terminology">shell</dfn> language.  It is called a shell because it is the user interface or the outermost layer "around" aka providing access to the operating system. Given that the Graphical User Interface (GUI) came into widespread use decades ago, it may seem surprising that nearly all software developers utilize the non-graphical CLI. The primary reasons for this include:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">Power.</span></span><p>The CLI facilitates features that are unavailable or difficult to access in a GUI. The mouse only allows for picking among the small set of predetermined options from the screen. However, for most systems many more options are actually available. In addition, most operating systems  prevent you from performing certain tasks which are system protected unless you are using the CLI.</p>
</li>
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">Speed.</span></span><p>The CLI facilitates all commands at the speed one can type them, which is typically many times faster than commands can typically be selected from a menu. In addition, GUIs utilize many more resources than simple text, so even for a slow typist, the CLI is faster.</p>
</li>
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">Automation.</span></span><p>If you need to do something that is repetitive or requires combining multiple commands, the CLI facilitates this with ease. Try using a GUI to find all files that contain a particular pattern and then perform some operation on all of them â€” this easy (often in a single command) with a CLI.</p>
