<p>There are a number of ways one can create a new file from the shell. Let's try a few. First, use <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">cd</code> to descend into one of your new directories, if you are not already in one, and type <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">ls</code>. You should be in an empty directory. Then let's try the following commands:<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">touch newfile1.txt
echo 'I love open source!' &gt; newfile2.txt
echo 'I really love open source!' &gt;&gt; newfile3.txt
  ls
</pre>You should now see three new files named <em class="emphasis">newfile1.txt</em>, <em class="emphasis">newfile2.txt</em>, and <em class="emphasis">newfile3.txt</em> respectively. The <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">touch</code> command simply makes an empty file, so the first line we typed is pretty straightforward. The second and third lines that we typed require a bit more explanation. The <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">echo</code> command simply echoes the argument(s), so if we had just typed <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore"> echo 'I love open source!'</code>, then  'I love open source!' would be repeated on the screen (without the quotation marks.) This might not seem very useful, but it is widely used in shell scripts to output status text or variable values to the screen or to a file. Both <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">&gt;</code> and <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">&gt;&gt;</code> are used to redirect the output to someplace other than the screen.</p>
<p>Output redirection with <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">&gt;</code> or <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">&gt;&gt;</code> is a feature in Linux that allows to change the standard input/output devices. The standard input device is the keyboard, and the standard output device is the screen, but sometimes we want to change this. With output redirection, the above standard output can be changed to go into a file, and that is exactly what we did above. Note that the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">&gt;</code> is the output redirection operator used for <em class="emphasis">overwriting</em> files that might or might not already exist in the directory, while the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">&gt;&gt;</code> is an output operator that appends the data of an existing file (or creates a new file by that name if one did not already exist.) So, <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">&gt;</code> should be used judiciously.</p>
<p>Let's look at the contents of the files that we created. The <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">cat</code> command stands for <em class="emphasis">concatenate</em> is used to print on the standard output device (usually your screen for our purposes) or to concatenate files.  To use <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">cat</code> to see the file contents, type the following one at a time:<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">cat newfile1.txt
cat newfile2.txt
cat newfile3.txt
</pre>You can also use the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">cat</code> command to concatenate files. For example, if you try:<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">cat newfile2.txt newfile3.txt &gt; newfile1.txt
cat newfile1.txt
</pre>You should see that <em class="emphasis">newfile1.txt</em> instead of being empty, now contains the concatenation of <em class="emphasis">newfile2.txt</em> and <em class="emphasis">newfile3.txt</em></p>
<p>We can also move files around, make a copy of files, or remove (delete) files from the filesystem using <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">mv</code>, <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">cp</code>, and <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">rm</code> respectively. Let's see how these work. First, list your files. You should have  <em class="emphasis">newfile1.txt</em>, <em class="emphasis">newfile2.txt</em>, and <em class="emphasis">newfile3.txt</em> in your directory.</p>
<p>Let's make a new directory below our current directory and move one of our files there.<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">mkdir subdir
mv newfile3.txt subdir/newfile3.txt
ls
ls subdir
</pre>You should see that newfile3.txt is now not in the current directory, but it is instead in the subdirectory <em class="emphasis">subdir</em>.</p>
<p>In addition to moving files around in the directory structure, we can also use the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">mv</code> command to rename files as follows:<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">mv newfile1.txt newfile4.txt
 ls
</pre>One important thing to watch out for with the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">mv</code> command is that if the destination filename already exists, it might get overwritten. For this reason, you might want to use the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">-i</code> flag which stands for interactive. Try it.<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">mv -i newfile1.txt newfile2.txt
</pre>You should see a question like, "overwrite 'newfile2.txt'?"If you respond with "n", then the file will not be overwritten.</p>
<p>The <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">cp</code>command works as you might expect:<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">cp newfile2.txt newfile2_cp.txt
cat newfile2_cp.txt
</pre>Just like with the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">mv</code>, command the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">cp</code> command will overwrite the destination file if it already exists. For this reason, you might want to use the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">-i</code> flag which stands for interactive. Try it.<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">mv -i newfile4.txt newfile2_cp.txt
</pre>You should see a question like, "overwrite 'newfile2_cp.txt'?" If you respond with "n", the command will not overwrite, so using the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">-i</code> flag seems a wise safeguard.</p>
<p>The <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">rm</code> command is a useful, but another dangerous command.  Let's try it:<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">rm newfile2_cp.txt
</pre>Just as with <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">cp</code>, and <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">mv</code>, you are probably wise to use the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">-i</code> option.<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">rm -i newfile4.txt
</pre>And, if you respond with "n", then the removal will not happen.</p></section><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_dev_basic_shell_commands.html#paragraphs-10" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
