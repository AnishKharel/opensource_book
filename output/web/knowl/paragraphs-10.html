<p></p>
<p>If you want to see all of the command options for a given command, there are two different methods for many commands. You can often, but not always, use the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">--help</code> option on the command or you can use the <dfn class="terminology">manual</dfn> which is accessed using the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">man</code> command. For example, with the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">ls</code> command, you can use either one of the following, noting that they work a bit differently because the manual may use paging. If it does, to go to the next page use the space bar.</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">ls --help
man ls
</pre>
<p>Note that since both <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">--help</code> and <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">man</code> are not consistently both available, it is worth knowing both. That way, if one doesn't work, you can try the other.</p>
<p>You may be wondering about the use of one minus sign '-' vs the use of two minus signs '--' in shell options. One minus sign is typically used for single letter commands, while two is typically used for word-length commands, although even this is not a hard and fast rule. You'll occasionally get programs that also use a single `-` for word-length commands. If you look back at the help and/or manual results for <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">ls</code>, you may see that the options <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">-a</code> and <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">--all</code> both list all files including that begin with a '.', which are the hidden files  and directories. Besides brevity, one advantage the single minus sign often offers, is that to run multiple options at the same time, all you often need to do is concatenate them. Note that this is also program-specific; not all programs will allow this, but it is convenient when it is offered! For example, <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">ls -lra</code> returns the result with  the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">-l</code>,  <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">-r</code>, and <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">-a</code> option flags all activated. Give it a try!</p>
