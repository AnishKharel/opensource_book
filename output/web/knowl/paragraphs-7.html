<p></p>
<p>We all likely understand that a <dfn class="terminology">file</dfn> is just a container for storing information. On a phone or in a GUI, we typically see files as icons with the filename below or to the right. We might (or might not) be familiar with using folders to organize our files and to navigate the file system. (On an Iphone or Android phone, you make a new folder by dropping one app on top of another app, on a Mac you long press and then choose new folder, and on a Windows machine, you right-click and choose New &gt; folder.) This type of organization is important to understand, and the folder metaphor is useful. In fact, there are two useful metaphors or mental models to help with our understanding of file systems. Note that when using the shell, these "folders" are more typically called <dfn class="terminology">directories</dfn>, but using the "folder" as your mental model for a directory will be very effective. This mental model tells us that inside of a directory, we can find files and possibly additional directories. Technically speaking, a directory is actually just a file that contains a list of other files, so you will see the both files and directories presented similarly by the shell. Using a different metaphor, you can think of all of the directories in your entire system as forming a tree structure which grows downward from a single directory which is known as the <dfn class="terminology">root directory</dfn>. In other words, the top level directory which is the parent of all directories is called the 'root' directory. It is referenced by the use of forward slash symbol (<dfn class="terminology">/</dfn>) when the forward slash symbol is used alone (or at least with nothing prepended in front of it). (As a comparison, the root directory notation in a standard Windows set-up is the C: directory.) </p>
<p>First, let's get our bearings and see which directory we are currently in. The <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">pwd</code> command stands for <em class="emphasis">print working directory</em> and as the name says it prints the name of the directory you are working in. Try typing:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">pwd
</pre>
<p>When I type this, I see the following:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">/home/pearcej
</pre>
<p>Reading from right to left, this means I am in a <dfn class="terminology">child</dfn> directory named <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">pearcej</code> which itself is a child of a directory called <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">home</code> which is itself a child of the root directory. If you prefer the folder metaphor to the tree metaphor, you can think of <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">pearcej</code> as being "inside" of the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">home</code> directory, which is inside of the root directory. Note that the position with respect to the forward slash '/' tells us the direction of the relationship â€“ further to the right is further "inside".</p>
<p>Let's try "moving" (i.e. changing our working directory) to the root directory. Use the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">cd</code> command which stands for <em class="emphasis">change directory</em> followed by the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">/</code> by typing:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">cd /
</pre>
<p>This should transport you to the <dfn class="terminology">root directory</dfn> (if you weren't there already.) Now when you use <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">pwd</code>, you should see <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">/</code> echoed back. Note that the term <em class="emphasis">root directory</em> shouldn't be confused with the term <em class="emphasis">root user</em> in a Linux-like system. The <dfn class="terminology">root user</dfn> is a user named <em class="emphasis">root</em>, which is a special superuser account in Linux operating systems that has unrestricted read and write privileges to everything. The <em class="emphasis">root directory</em> should also not be confused with the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">/root</code> folder which is found on some Linux-based sytems and which is the home directory of the root superuser.</p>
<p>Next type the following <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">ls</code> to get a <em class="emphasis">listing</em> of the files and subdirectories in the <em class="emphasis">root directory</em>.</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">ls
