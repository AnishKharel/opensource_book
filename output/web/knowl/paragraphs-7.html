<p></p>
<p>Let's explore the permissions portions of the lines produced by the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">ls -l</code> command. The last item on each of these lines is the filename itself. The first item in each of the lines is a 10 character-long mix of letters and minus signs. The first character of that set indicates the file type where <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">d</code> tells us it is a directory, <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">l</code> indicates it is a symbolic link, and <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">-</code> indicates it is a regular file. The next nine characters display various permissions for the file. The first set of three characters (characters 2-4) are the user's (i.e. the file owner's) permissions, the next three are the group's permissions, and the last three are the permissions for all others. (The user's name  is in the third column and the group name is in the fourth column.) In each of these sets of three characters, the three characters refer to read (<code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">r</code>), write (<code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">w</code>), and execute (<code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">x</code>) respectively. If you see a letter then that permission is allowed, and if you see a '-', the permission is disallowed. For example in the last of the three lines shown above, we see that the file <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">hello.txt</code> has permissions of <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">-rw-rw-r--</code>. This means this is a file that can be read and written (changed) but not executed by the owner <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">pearcej</code> and also by any user who is a member of the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">friends</code> group, however other users can only read the file.</p>
<p>Occasionally, you need to change permissions of a file. For example, you might need to change permissions to make a file executable. Changing file permissions is done with the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">chmod</code> command. We will explore this in a bit.</p></section><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_dev_basic_shell_commands.html#paragraphs-7" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
