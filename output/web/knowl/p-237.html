<span class="heading"><span class="title">What is a <dfn class="terminology">terminal</dfn>?</span></span><div class="para">The English word <dfn class="terminology">terminal</dfn> means to be situated at the end of something, and the term’s meaning in computing has evolved since it was originally coined in the 1960s.</div>
<div class="para">Prior to the development of the first programmable electronic computers, computers were people (mostly women) who used mechanical calculators to compute complex mathematical computations quickly and accurately. The earliest electronic computers, such as Colossus and ENIAC, required specialized technical knowledge and skill to program because programming these machines was a complex process that involved physically entering commands flipping switches, pushing buttons, and manually moving patch cords. The development of the <dfn class="terminology">terminal interface</dfn> in the 1960s marked a significant shift in the way users interacted with computers because the terminal provided a convenient and much more accessible way to provide input and obtain output, allowing users to remotely interact with a computer via a keyboard and screen.  Back when the terminal was first used in computing, what we refer to as the terminal today was the only interface available to the user, while now it is used to refer to a specific type of text-based programming interface. In particular, today a <dfn class="terminology">terminal</dfn> simply refers to a text-based interface that allows a user to interact with a computer by entering commands and receiving output on a display screen.</div>

<span class="heading"><span class="title">What is a <dfn class="terminology">console</dfn>?</span></span><div class="para">The English word <dfn class="terminology">console</dfn> comes from the related verb, <em class="emphasis">to console</em>, which means to provide support. In computing, the original meaning of the <dfn class="terminology">console</dfn> was as a physical device that supported input into and output from a computer. The term is still used that way, but it has also come to be synonymous with terminal in some environments. For example, if you search for console on a Windows machine, you may find the terminal program and/or you may find a security console program.</div>

<span class="heading"><span class="title">What is a <dfn class="terminology">Command Line Interface (CLI)</dfn>?</span></span><div class="para">A <dfn class="terminology">CLI</dfn> refers to any interface that works with text-based commands and text-based output. We will be using a <dfn class="terminology">shell</dfn>, which is an example of a CLI.</div>
</li>
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">What is a <dfn class="terminology">shell</dfn>?</span></span><div class="para">A <dfn class="terminology">shell</dfn> is a program which parses and interprets the commands you enter in the terminal and then executes them, often using functionality provided directly by the operating system. In other words, a shell is a CLI which serves as the interface between the end-user and the operating system. It is called a shell because it is a user interface layer directly surrounding the <dfn class="terminology">kernel</dfn>, which is the innermost part of the operating system</div>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="para">A terminal/console will typically seamlessly offer direct access to a shell as well as other CLI programs, so although these terms are distinct from one another as described above, you will often hear people use the terms terminal, CLI, console, and shell almost interchangeably. Don’t let it worry you too much because you should almost always be able to understand what is meant from the context.</div>
