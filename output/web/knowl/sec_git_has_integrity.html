<p></p>
<p>Everything in Git is stored via a unique digital fingerprint of the data. This means it’s impossible to change the contents of any file or directory without Git knowing about it. This functionality is built into Git at the lowest levels and is integral to its philosophy. You can’t lose information in transit or get file corruption without Git being able to detect it.</p>
<p>The mechanism that Git uses for creating this unique digital fingerprint of the data is called a <dfn class="terminology">SHA-1 hash</dfn>. This is a 40-character string composed of hexadecimal characters (0–9 and a–f) and calculated based on the contents of a file or directory structure in Git. A SHA-1 hash looks something like this:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">24b9da6552252987aa493b52f8696cd6d3b00373
</pre>
<p>You will see these hash values all over the place in Git because it uses them so much. In fact, Git stores everything in its repository not by file name but by the hash value of its contents. Because they are a long incomprehensible strings, they look strange, but try not to let that bother you.</p></section><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_git_getting_started.html#sec_git_has_integrity" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
