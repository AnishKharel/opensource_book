<p>The bridge of communication in a Linux system between the user applications and the underlying hardware is called the Linux kernel, and it is an open source software project of fairly large scope. During the early years of the Linux kernel maintenance (1991â€“2002), changes to the software were passed around as patches and archived files. In 2002, the Linux kernel project began using a proprietary DVCS called BitKeeper.</p>
