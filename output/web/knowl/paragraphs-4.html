<p>Some countries have a notion of <dfn class="terminology">fair use</dfn> or <dfn class="terminology">fair dealing</dfn> which are somewhat difficult to understand but even so are critically important because in many countries limited, specific uses can be made without permission from the copyright owner. <article class="definition definition-like"><h5 class="heading">

<p>In many of the common law jurisdictions of the Commonwealth of Nations, <dfn class="terminology">fair dealing</dfn> allows for copying of copyrighted materials if and only if they are used for a purpose that is among a list of purposes that is specific to each country.</p></article></p>
<p>For example, in a large number of the countries that permit fair-dealing uses, copying of copyrighted material for the purpose of review and criticism or for the purpose of reporting the news are both considered "fair dealing."</p>

<p>In the United States (US) and a few other countries a notion called <dfn class="terminology">fair use</dfn> allows copying of copyrighted material if done for a "limited" and also “transformative” purpose.  For example, in the US, fair use is often used by various types of critics to quote a limited portion of a work and by professors to make a limited portion of a work available to their students.</p></article></p>
<p>What do <em class="emphasis">"limited" and “transformative” purpose</em> mean? Well, many millions of US dollars have been spent arguing just that question. If you really want to just see how confusing the notion of fair use is in the US, see <a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_LLC_v._Oracle_America,_Inc." target="_blank">Google v. Oracle</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-41-hidden.html" title="Footnote 3.1.3"><sup> 3 </sup></a> which ultimately ended up in the US Supreme Court battling exactly that question.</p>
<p>Because the notions of fair use and fair dealing vary significantly by country, researching the laws in your specific country is highly advisable.</p></section><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_licensing_about.html#paragraphs-4" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
