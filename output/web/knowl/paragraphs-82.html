When a developer has decided to spend a day “fixing bugs,” that developer likely starts by scanning the bug list. If she sees a bug summary that says “your program is broken,” it’s unlikely to provoke a favorable response. Summaries matter. The goal is to pack as much information into a single line of text. The more information the developer sees in a bug summary, the more likely she is to dig into that bug.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_issues_bugs.html#paragraphs-82" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
