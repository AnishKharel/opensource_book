<p>People might tell you documentation doesnâ€™t matter. In a perfect world, it might not. If all code were self-evident and all programs worked for users without needing help, if all work and communities were easy to participate in, perhaps we could do without documentation. Of course, that would require all people to think and act in similar ways; we may never be without documentation simply because we are a diverse species.</p>
