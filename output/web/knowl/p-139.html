<p>In addition to web hosting, several other forms of asynchronous communication tools are provided as part of the typical OSS software engineering collaboration platform. These tools arise naturally from the need to discuss issues surrounding code and code improvements. While these often include the following, nt all of these area utilized by every project and even when they are utilized, they often exist apart from the SECP:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">Bug and Issue Trackers.</span></span><p>Issue trackers were originally designed to record, track, and resolve user-encountered issues including bugs. However, issue trackers are also often used by users to submit feature-requests.</p>
<p>When an issue is posted, short discussions on the posted issue typically are attached to the issue itself, which facilitates the tracking of that discussion, which is particularly important in larger projects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">Discussion and Project Queues.</span></span><p>Many OSS projects span multiple code repositories. Discussion and project queues afford discussions that limited to a single issue or feature request and/or aren't specific to a single code repository.</p>
</li>
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">Request for code integration (aka pull request).</span></span><p>Software developers use <dfn class="terminology">pull request</dfn> to describe a request to initiate the process of requesting an integration of specific code changes into the project repository.  Like issue trackers, pull requests are not merely a notification, instead pull requests typically serves as an entirely separate thread for discussing the new code.</p>
<p>Even in the best of circumstances a typical pull request initiates further discussion and/or recommendation(s) for improvements from the core team of the OSS project. To those new to the OSS world, these discussions might come as a surprise, but they should not. Best practice is to have initiated a far earlier discussion using something like the favored issue tracker or other form or asynchronous communication utilized by the project.</p>
