<p>The first place where people discover an OSS community is typically a website. Unfortunately, the nature of traditional HTML pages is that they are often a static, one-to-many form of communication created by a small number of people with write access to the server. This leads to web sites that can become quickly outdated and which do not truly reflect the collaborative nature of the community. We will see how OSS communities work around this issue and make their website a collaborative project as well in the next section.</p>
