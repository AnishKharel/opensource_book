<p>Another thing that is very useful in the shell is the use of regular expressions. A <dfn class="terminology">regular expression</dfn> (aka <dfn class="terminology">regex</dfn>) is a sequence of characters that specifies a text search pattern. Regular expressions are quite powerful, and it is not within the scope of this textbook to teach them, instead this paragraph is intended to alert you to how useful they can be. A couple examples of very common regular expressions patterns are using wildcards for zero or more characters or for a single character.  The asterisk (*) specifies zero or more characters to match. In bash the question mark (?) is used for matching exactly one single character, although this is not typical regex behavior.</p>
