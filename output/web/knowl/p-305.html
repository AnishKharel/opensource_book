<p>You may be wondering about the use of one minus sign '-' vs the use of two minus signs '--' in shell options. One minus sign is typically used for single letter commands, while two is typically used for word-length commands, although even this is not a hard and fast rule. You'll occasionally get programs that also use a single `-` for word-length commands. If you look back at the help and/or manual results for <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">ls</code>, you may see that the options <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">-a</code> and <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">--all</code> both list all files including that begin with a '.', which are the hidden files  and directories. Besides brevity, one advantage the single minus sign often offers, is that to run multiple options at the same time, all you often need to do is concatenate them. Note that this is also program-specific; not all programs will allow this, but it is convenient when it is offered! For example, <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">ls -lra</code> returns the result with  the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">-l</code>,  <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">-r</code>, and <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">-a</code> option flags all activated. Give it a try!</p>
