<p>In open source communities documentation is a key tool. Documentation needs to exist to explain why decisions were made, how to get things running, how the code is organized and works, and what steps must be taken to contribute. You have to document everything that you do in a open source project, and this is not just with the code. Next year when you need to remember why a technical decision was made, the answer should be readily available in the documentation.</p>
