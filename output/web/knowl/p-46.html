<p>Open source software is typically developed in a collaborative way. It often relies upon peer review and community member contributions, frequently with community members from all over the world. In addition to seeing the code, often anyone can also freely modify and distribute the code as they see fit as long as the open source license is followed. We will explore licensing details in <a href="ch_licensing.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 3: Open Source Licensing">ChapterÂ 3</a></p>
