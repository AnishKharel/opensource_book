<p>If the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git status</code> command is too vague for you — you want to know exactly what you changed, not just which files were changed — you can use the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git diff</code> command. We’ll cover <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git diff</code> in more detail later, but you’ll probably use it most often to answer these two questions: What have you changed but not yet staged? And what have you staged that you are about to commit? Although <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git status</code> answers those questions very generally by listing the file names, <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git diff</code> shows you the exact lines added and removed — the patch, as it were.</p>
<p>Let’s say you edit and stage the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">README</code> file again and then edit the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">CONTRIBUTING.md</code> file without staging it. If you run your <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git status</code> command, you once again see something like this:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)

    modified:   README

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;..." to discard changes in working directory)

    modified:   CONTRIBUTING.md
</pre>
<p>To see what you’ve changed but not yet staged, type <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git diff</code> with no other arguments:</p>

<p>That command compares what is in your working directory with what is in your staging area. The result tells you the changes you’ve made that you haven’t yet staged.</p>
<p>If you want to see what you’ve staged that will go into your next commit, you can use <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git diff --staged</code>. This command compares your staged changes to your last commit:</p>

<p>It’s important to note that <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git diff</code> by itself doesn’t show all changes made since your last commit — only changes that are still unstaged. If you’ve staged all of your changes, <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git diff</code> will give you no output.</p>
<p>For another example, if you stage the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">CONTRIBUTING.md</code> file and then edit it, you can use <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git diff</code> to see the changes in the file that are staged and the changes that are unstaged. If our environment looks like this:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">$ git add CONTRIBUTING.md
$ echo '# test line' &gt;&gt; CONTRIBUTING.md
$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)

<p>Note: Git Diff in an External Tool</p>
<p>We will continue to use the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git diff</code> command in various ways throughout the rest of the book. There is another way to look at these diffs if you prefer a graphical or external diff viewing program instead. If you run <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git difftool</code> instead of <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git diff</code>, you can view any of these diffs in software like emerge, vimdiff and many more (including commercial products). Run <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git difftool --tool-help</code> to see what is available on your system.</p></section><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_git_basics.html#_git_diff_staged" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
