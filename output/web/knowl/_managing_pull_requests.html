<section class="paragraphs"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Managing Pull Requests.</span></h4>
<p>Now that you have a project with some code in it and maybe even a few collaborators who also have push access, let’s go over what to do when you get a Pull Request yourself.</p>
<p>Pull Requests can either come from a branch in a fork of your repository or they can come from another branch in the same repository. The only difference is that the ones in a fork are often from people where you can’t push to their branch and they can’t push to yours, whereas with internal Pull Requests generally both parties can access the branch.</p>
<p>For these examples, let’s assume you are “tonychacon” and you’ve created a new Arduino code project named “fade”.</p>
<section class="paragraphs"><h5 class="heading"><span class="title">Email Notifications.</span></h5>
<p>Someone comes along and makes a change to your code and sends you a Pull Request. You should get an email notifying you about the new Pull Request and it should look something like <a class="external" href="ch00/_email_pr" target="_blank">Email notification of a new Pull Request</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-173-hidden.html" title="Footnote 5.6.29"><sup> 29 </sup></a>.</p>
<figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 100%; margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%;"><img src="external/github-maint-01-email.png" class="contained"></div>
<figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">5.6.24<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span>Email notification of a new Pull Request</figcaption></figure><p>There are a few things to notice about this email. It will give you a small diffstat — a list of files that have changed in the Pull Request and by how much. It gives you a link to the Pull Request on GitHub. It also gives you a few URLs that you can use from the command line.</p>
<p>If you notice the line that says <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git pull &lt;url&gt; patch-1</code>, this is a simple way to merge in a remote branch without having to add a remote. We went over this quickly in <a class="external" href="ch00/_checking_out_remotes" target="_blank">Checking Out Remote Branches</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-174-hidden.html" title="Footnote 5.6.30"><sup> 30 </sup></a>. If you wish, you can create and switch to a topic branch and then run this command to merge in the Pull Request changes.</p>
<p>The other interesting URLs are the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">.diff</code> and <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">.patch</code> URLs, which as you may guess, provide unified diff and patch versions of the Pull Request. You could technically merge in the Pull Request work with something like this:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">$ curl https://github.com/tonychacon/fade/pull/1.patch | git am
</pre></section><section class="paragraphs"><h5 class="heading"><span class="title">Collaborating on the Pull Request.</span></h5>
<p>As we covered in <a class="external" href="ch00/ch06-github_flow" target="_blank">The GitHub Flow</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-175-hidden.html" title="Footnote 5.6.31"><sup> 31 </sup></a>, you can now have a conversation with the person who opened the Pull Request. You can comment on specific lines of code, comment on whole commits or comment on the entire Pull Request itself, using GitHub Flavored Markdown everywhere.</p>
<p>Every time someone else comments on the Pull Request you will continue to get email notifications so you know there is activity happening. They will each have a link to the Pull Request where the activity is happening and you can also directly respond to the email to comment on the Pull Request thread.</p>

<figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">5.6.25<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span>Responses to emails are included in the thread</figcaption></figure><p>Once the code is in a place you like and want to merge it in, you can either pull the code down and merge it locally, either with the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git pull &lt;url&gt; &lt;branch&gt;</code> syntax we saw earlier, or by adding the fork as a remote and fetching and merging.</p>
<p>If the merge is trivial, you can also just hit the “Merge” button on the GitHub site. This will do a “non-fast-forward” merge, creating a merge commit even if a fast-forward merge was possible. This means that no matter what, every time you hit the merge button, a merge commit is created. As you can see in <a class="external" href="ch00/_merge_button" target="_blank">Merge button and instructions for merging a Pull Request manually</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-176-hidden.html" title="Footnote 5.6.32"><sup> 32 </sup></a>, GitHub gives you all of this information if you click the hint link.</p>

<p>Not only can you open Pull Requests that target the main or <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">main</code> branch, you can actually open a Pull Request targeting any branch in the network. In fact, you can even target another Pull Request.</p>
<p>If you see a Pull Request that is moving in the right direction and you have an idea for a change that depends on it or you’re not sure is a good idea, or you just don’t have push access to the target branch, you can open a Pull Request directly to it.</p>
<p>When you go to open a Pull Request, there is a box at the top of the page that specifies which branch you’re requesting to pull to and which you’re requesting to pull from. If you hit the “Edit” button at the right of that box you can change not only the branches but also which fork.</p>
