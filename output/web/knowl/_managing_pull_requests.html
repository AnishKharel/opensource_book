<section class="paragraphs"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Managing Pull Requests.</span></h4>  <div class="para">Now that you have a project with some code in it and maybe even a few collaborators who also have push access, let’s go over what to do when you get a Pull Request yourself.</div>  <div class="para">Pull Requests can either come from a branch in a fork of your repository or they can come from another branch in the same repository. The only difference is that the ones in a fork are often from people where you can’t push to their branch and they can’t push to yours, whereas with internal Pull Requests generally both parties can access the branch.</div>  <section class="paragraphs"><h5 class="heading"><span class="title">Email Notifications.</span></h5>  <div class="para">Someone comes along and makes a change to your code and sends you a Pull Request. You should get an email notifying you about the new Pull Request.</div>  <div class="para">There are a few things to notice about this email. It will give you a small diffstat — a list of files that have changed in the Pull Request and by how much. It gives you a link to the Pull Request on GitHub. It also gives you a few URLs that you can use from the command line.</div> gblock"&gt;--&gt; </section> <section class="paragraphs"><h5 class="heading"><span class="title">Collaborating on the Pull Request.</span></h5>  <div class="para">As we covered above, you can now have a conversation with the person who opened the Pull Request. You can comment on specific lines of code, comment on whole commits or comment on the entire Pull Request itself, using GitHub Flavored Markdown everywhere.</div>  <div class="para">Every time someone else comments on the Pull Request you will continue to get email notifications so you know there is activity happening. They will each have a link to the Pull Request where the activity is happening and you can also directly respond to the email to comment on the Pull Request thread.</div> <div class="para">Once the code is in a place you like and want to merge it in, you can either pull the code down and merge it locally, either with the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git pull &lt;url&gt; &lt;branch&gt;</code> syntax we saw earlier, or by adding the fork as a remote and fetching and merging.</div>  <div class="para">If the merge is trivial, you can also just hit the “Merge” button on the GitHub site. This will do a “non-fast-forward” merge, creating a merge commit even if a fast-forward merge was possible. This means that no matter what, every time you hit the merge button, a merge commit is created. As you can see in <a class="external" href="ch00/_merge_button" target="_blank">Merge button and instructions for merging a Pull Request manually</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-156-hidden.html" title="Footnote 5.6.14"><sup> 14 </sup></a>, GitHub gives you all of this information if you click the hint link.</div>  <div class="para">If you decide you don’t want to merge it, you can also just close the Pull Request and the person who opened it will be notified.</div> </section> <section class="paragraphs"><h5 class="heading"><span class="title">Pull Requests on Pull Requests.</span></h5>  <div class="para">Not only can you open Pull Requests that target the main or <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">main</code> branch, you can actually open a Pull Request targeting any branch in the network. In fact, you can even target another Pull Request.</div>  <div class="para">If you see a Pull Request that is moving in the right direction and you have an idea for a change that depends on it or you’re not sure is a good idea, or you just don’t have push access to the target branch, you can open a Pull Request directly to it.</div>  <div class="para">When you go to open a Pull Request, there is a box at the top of the page that specifies which branch you’re requesting to pull to and which you’re requesting to pull from. If you hit the “Edit” button at the right of that box you can change not only the branches but also which fork.</div> </section></section><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_git_github.html#_managing_pull_requests" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
