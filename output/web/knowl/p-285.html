<div class="para">Inside of a directory, we can find files and possibly additional directories. Since directories may contain other directories in addition to files, the directories on your computer form a hierarchy. Each directory is contained within another directory, which we refer to as its <dfn class="terminology">parent</dfn>. The only exception to this rule is the  <dfn class="terminology">root directory</dfn>, which can be a parent to other directories, but has no parent itself. It is therefore the top-level directory from which we can reach any other directory. Each file and directory in the file system can be referred to by its unique <dfn class="terminology">path</dfn>. The root directory always has the path <dfn class="terminology">/</dfn>, and a file can thus be identified by its path through the file system beginning from the root node. If there is a folder named <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">myfolder</code> located in the root directory, its path would be <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">/myfolder</code>. If <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">myfolder</code> then contains a file named <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">hello.txt</code>, its path would be <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">/myfolder/hello.txt</code>. If <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">/myfolder</code> contains a directory named <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">/mydocuments</code>, its path would be <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">/myfolder/mydocuments</code>. And so on." </div>
