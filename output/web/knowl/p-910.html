<span class="heading"><span class="title">Letting the user know that someone has looked at it.</span></span><p> This simple courtesy is frequently overlooked. Bug trackers send emails to the original reporter whenever the state of a bug changes in any way — and when a user files a bug and never hears any response at all, it’s discouraging and makes it less likely that the user will bother to file another bug. A response such as, “thanks for reporting, I’ll try to reproduce today” can be very helpful.</p>
</li>
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">Looking for other similar bugs.</span></span><p> A large percentage of bugs filed against open source projects are duplicates; users frequently report bugs without searching to see if similar bugs have already been filed. Finding duplicates becomes easier with a bit of practice; the more familiar you are with a program, and the more you communicate with its developers, and the more bugs you see coming through the bug tracker, the more likely it is that you know when a bug is a duplicate. Still, even an inexperienced triager can spot obvious duplicates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">Guaranteeing proper severity and/or priority.</span></span><p> Users tend to think that their bugs are the most important issues in the world. Sometimes, they’re right. Often, they’re not. Part of the triager’s job is to make a good faith estimate of a bug’s severity and priority. It’s an imperfect process, so triagers are also be wrong sometimes — but experienced bug triagers are much less wrong.</p>
</li>
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">Ensuring that the bug is sensible and helpful to developers.</span></span><p> A poorly written bug report should never even make its way into the developer’s queue. If a bug report is filed with absolutely no information, it’s the triager’s job to get that information — with a politely worded comment in the bug, something like this: “Thanks for filing the bug, but there isn’t much information here. Could you help by telling us what version of Barchat you’re running, and if possible, attach the last 100 lines of ~/.barchatlog?”</p>
</li>
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">Ensuring that the bug is filed against the correct component, with the correct version.</span></span><p> Sometimes, bugs are simply filed with the wrong information in some of the fields and it is obviously wrong. When a bug report about foomail accidentally gets filed against foomatic, reassiging that bug to the right component is simple — but vital.</p>
