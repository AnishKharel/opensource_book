<p>This way, projects don’t have to worry about adding users as collaborators to give them push access. People can fork a project, push to it, and contribute their changes back to the original repository by creating a merge request which in GitHub is called a <dfn class="terminology">pull request</dfn>. We’ll cover this next. Making a pull request opens up a discussion thread with code review, and the owner and the contributor can then communicate about the change until the owner is happy with it, at which point the owner can merge it in.</p>
