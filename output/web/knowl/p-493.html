<p>Remember, anything that is <em class="emphasis">committed</em> in Git can almost always be recovered. Even commits that were on branches that were deleted or commits that were overwritten with an <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">--amend</code> commit can be recovered. However, anything you lose that was never committed is likely never to be seen again.</p>
