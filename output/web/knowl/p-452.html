<p>If the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git status</code> command is too vague for you — you want to know exactly what you changed, not just which files were changed — you can use the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git diff</code> command. We’ll cover <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git diff</code> in more detail later, but you’ll probably use it most often to answer these two questions: What have you changed but not yet staged? And what have you staged that you are about to commit? Although <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git status</code> answers those questions very generally by listing the file names, <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git diff</code> shows you the exact lines added and removed — the patch, as it were.</p>
