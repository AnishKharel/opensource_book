<p></p>
<p>Next, let's go to your <dfn class="terminology">home</dfn> directory which is referenced by the special tilde '~' character as follows: </p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">cd ~
</pre>
<p>Then print your working directory and list your files just to see that you have been transported again.</p>
<p>You can make a new directory using the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">mkdir</code> command. For example, let's say you want to make a new directory with the name <em class="emphasis">newdir</em>, you can type the following:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">mkdir newdir
</pre>
<p>To check that the directory was created as expected, you can get a fresh listing of your files and directories with <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">ls -l</code>. The output should include a line that ends in `newdir`. Try it!</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">drwxr-xr-x  2 pearcej pearcej   4096 Nov 15 17:00 newdir
</pre>
<p>Then you can descend into the new directory and see where you are with:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">cd newdir
pwd
</pre>
<p>You should note that your working directory has changed! One might expect not to see anything when running the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">ls</code> command in an empty directory, but try it with the following options:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">ls -la
</pre>
<p>You are likely to see something like the following:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">drwxr-xr-x  2 pearcej pearcej 4096 Nov 16 17:00 .
drwxr-xr-x 13 pearcej pearcej 4096 Nov 16 17:00 ..
</pre>
<p>Note the period at the end of the first line where the filename is expected. A period or dot (.) represents the current directory. The double period or double dot (..) represents the parent directory of the current one. </p>
<p>You can use this dot notation as a reference as well, so <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">ls ..</code>, will list all the files and directories in the parent directory relative to where you are so you don't have to change directories to get the listing from another directory. Try it!</p>
<p>You can even use these dots in combination with folder names. For example, if you are inside of the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">newdir</code> directory and you want to make a sibling directory called <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">newdir2</code>, you can type the following:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">mkdir ../newdir2
ls -l ..
</pre>
<p>Here, the first command directs us up to move up one level in the directory tree structure and to create a new directory named <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">newdir2</code>. This makes <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">newdir2</code> a sibling of the original <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">newdir</code> directory because both have the same parent directory. The second line produces a long listing of all of the files and directories in the directory that is one level up relative to the current working  directory. You should see both of the directories that you made listed as subdirectories.</p>
<p>If you want to delete either of these new empty directories, you can use the <dfn class="terminology">remove directory</dfn> command, <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">rmdir</code> followed by the name of the directory you want to remove. Note that there are other ways to remove directories, but <dfn class="terminology">remove directory</dfn> is useful because it refuses to delete a directory that is not empty. Give it a try!</p></section><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_dev_basic_shell_commands.html#paragraphs-11" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
