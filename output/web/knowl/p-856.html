<div class="para">Repairing or improving documentation has a reputation as being an easy way to begin contributing to a project. Newcomers can often make improvements to the documentation for such things as how to get a thing to run/compile because they will be going through that process and might run into an issue or outdated part of documentation. They are then in a great position to improve it based on their experience.</div>
