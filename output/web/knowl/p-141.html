<h4 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h4>
<p>Virtually every open source community uses a <dfn class="terminology">Software Engineering Collaboration Platform (SECP)</dfn> such as <a class="external" href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-34-hidden.html" title="Footnote 2.4.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a>, <a class="external" href="https://gitea.io/" target="_blank">Gitea</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-35-hidden.html" title="Footnote 2.4.2"><sup> 2 </sup></a>, <a class="external" href="https://gitlab.com/" target="_blank">GitLab</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-36-hidden.html" title="Footnote 2.4.3"><sup> 3 </sup></a>, or <a class="external" href="https://bitbucket.org/" target="_blank">Bitbucket</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-37-hidden.html" title="Footnote 2.4.4"><sup> 4 </sup></a>, each of which provides a comprehensive collection of features that are required for software development in OSS communities. These features arise naturally from the need store code, to discuss issues related to the code, to employ version control, and other needs:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">Repositories.</span></span><p>It goes without saying that an OSS needs to store the code base in a way that it can be accessed by the community of current and potential contributors. A <dfn class="terminology">repository</dfn>, aka <dfn class="terminology">repo</dfn>, is a file storage location used by a version control system to keep track of not only versions of the code base itself but also to keep track of project documentation, discussions, web pages, and more. Repos are nearly always hosted in a SECP, although they are also sometimes self-hosted by the project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">Issue Trackers.</span></span><p><dfn class="terminology">Issue trackers</dfn> are designed to record, track, and resolve bugs, feature requests, questions, etc. After an issue is posted, discussions on the issue typically occur and are sometimes prolonged. These discussions are most conveniently attached to the issue itself to facilitate the tracking of the discussion, which is particularly important in larger projects. When an issue is posted, it can be discussed by the community to decide on how to proceed with it. The issue can be categorized and linked to other discussions, projects, and engineering work as well. You are definitely advised to read all unresolved issues before posting so you are not duplicating another existing issue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">Merge Requests.</span></span><p>Software developers use the term <dfn class="terminology">merge request</dfn> or <dfn class="terminology">pull request (PR)</dfn> to describe a request to initiate the process of requesting an integration of specific code changes into the project repository. Best practice before making a merge request is to have initiated an earlier discussion using one of the forms of communication favored by the project. After this discussion, a (potential) contributor opens a merge request, which may then undergo several iterations of automatic checks, manual code reviews by one or more other contributor, as well as further discussion.</p>
<p>It is important to understand that even in the best of circumstances, the typical merge request initiates further discussion and/or recommendation(s) for improvements from the core team of the OSS project. To those new to the OSS world, these discussions may come as a surprise, but they should not. Even then the core OSS term is likely to ask for further refinements. This is normal and to be expected.</p>

<span class="heading"><span class="title">Project Boards.</span></span><p>A <dfn class="terminology">project board</dfn> facilitates organization of project tasks. Project boards typically utilize a visual tool similar to the <a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban" target="_blank">Kanban</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-38-hidden.html" title="Footnote 2.4.5"><sup> 5 </sup></a> scheduling system used in lean manufacturing. SECPs provide such boards, and many projects use the ones provided in their SECP. However, some projects use an external tool like <a class="external" href="https://trello.com/" target="_blank">Trello</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-39-hidden.html" title="Footnote 2.4.6"><sup> 6 </sup></a> or one of the open source alternatives such as <a class="external" href="https://kanboard.org/" target="_blank">Kanboard</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-40-hidden.html" title="Footnote 2.4.7"><sup> 7 </sup></a> or <a class="external" href="https://www.taiga.io/" target="_blank">Taiga</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-41-hidden.html" title="Footnote 2.4.8"><sup> 8 </sup></a>. These project boards are typically made up of things like issues, merge requests, files, tags, and notes that are categorized as cards which are organized into columns. Most platforms offer a lot of flexibility, so one can add tags, set deadlines, search, reorder columns, reorder cards within a column, move cards from one column to another column, etc. The project boards at: <a class="external" href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/projects?type=classic" target="_blank">Microsoft VSCode Project Boards</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-42-hidden.html" title="Footnote 2.4.9"><sup> 9 </sup></a> and <a class="external" href="https://github.com/orgs/Homebrew/projects?type=classic" target="_blank">Homebrew Project Boards</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-43-hidden.html" title="Footnote 2.4.10"><sup> 10 </sup></a>, and <a class="external" href="https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/projects?type=classic" target="_blank">NixOS Project Boards</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-44-hidden.html" title="Footnote 2.4.11"><sup> 11 </sup></a> offer good examples of projects that use the SECP's project boards.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="continuation"><p>One of the many features these software engineering collaboration platforms (SECP) sometimes offer is web hosting, which when enabled, facilitates structured collaborative editing of the site. As an example, <a class="external" href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-45-hidden.html" title="Footnote 2.4.12"><sup> 12 </sup></a> affords hosting as a website for projects that are managed on GitHub. This means that OSS communities can use their SECP of choice as their a host for their website as well.</p></p>
