<p>There are a handful of IRC networks used in open source, including ones operated by large projects (such as irc.mozilla.org) and ones which are operated by organizations and shared by many different communities (such as irc.freenode.net and irc.oftc.net). These are open channels and may be logged by one or more entities. Consider anything you say in IRC to be as public as if you said it on a busy street corner, with a megaphone, and seven people videotaping everything.</p>
