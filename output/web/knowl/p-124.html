<p>Ruth Hill Useem developed the term <a class="external" href="http://www.tckworld.com/" target="_blank">Third Culture Kids (TCKs)</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-30-hidden.html" title="Footnote 2.2.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a> forty years ago to describe the children of military, diplomatic, missionary, and other families who exist in a twilight world between their passport countries and the countries in which they live. Often, these children are neither at home in their birth culture nor in the culture in which they live day-to-day, a fact that often becomes evident only upon returning to their native country. TCKs usually feel more at home with other TCKs than with other people.</p>
