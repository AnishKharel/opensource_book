<p>A <dfn class="terminology">blog</dfn> is in some ways similar to a website in appearance. Websites provide semi-permanent places for content which is updated and replaced as needed. While in a blog, new articles that are published add to the content rather than replacing it (although existing posts can be updated as well if things change). Blogs provide a flow of transient, in-the-moment news, commentary, and technical articles which is posted by date, with past posts still available. Because many open source participants write blogs, it is sometimes difficult to keep up with them on a larger project. The volume of blog postings created within a community can be overwhelming. To help deal with this, RSS feeds enable the receipt of content in a machine-readable format so that it can be used in a variety of different ways through a service called a RSS feed aggregator. A few open-source community also maintain a Planet site which aggregates the feeds from that community into a single page (and the Planet, in turn, provides an aggregated feed). Here are some examples: <a class="external" href="https://planet.mozilla.org" target="_blank">The Mozilla Planet</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-53-hidden.html" title="Footnote 2.4.20"><sup> 20 </sup></a>, <a class="external" href="http://fedoraplanet.org/" target="_blank">The Fedora Planet</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-54-hidden.html" title="Footnote 2.4.21"><sup> 21 </sup></a>, and <a class="external" href="https://planet.documentfoundation.org/" target="_blank">The Document Foundation Planet</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-55-hidden.html" title="Footnote 2.4.22"><sup> 22 </sup></a>.</p>
