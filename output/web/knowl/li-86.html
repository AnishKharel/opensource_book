<p>If you are on a Windows machine, you have a number of options. On Windows, the terminal/shell is historically called the <dfn class="terminology">command prompt (cmd)</dfn>, although a newer very different terminal/shell called <dfn class="terminology">PowerShell</dfn> has also been around for decades. Neither of these terminal/shells are compatible with the default shell programs available on macOS and Linux. For OSS development, it will be preferable to have access to a shell that is compatible with the macOS and Linux ones.</p>
<p>If you are running Windows 10 or Windows 11, then following the directions from Microsoft on <a class="external" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install" target="_blank">Installing Linux on Windows with WSL2</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-109-hidden.html" title="Footnote 4.1.2"><sup> 2 </sup></a> will give you the best experience. Note that you may first need to update your version of Windows, see <a class="external" href="https://bit.ly/Windows-Update-FAQ" target="_blank"><code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">https://bit.ly/Windows-Update-FAQ</code></a>. WSL2 provides a full Linux kernel that is integrated into the Windows operating system. Installing <a class="external" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/install" target="_blank">the Windows Terminal</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-110-hidden.html" title="Footnote 4.1.3"><sup> 3 </sup></a> will further enhance your experience, although it is not strictly necessary. Once you have followed the linked directions to install WSL2, including the installation of Linux (Ubuntu is a good choice),  then the shell is most easily accessed by searching for Ubuntu in the search tool next to the Windows Icon and selecting it when you see it. For convenience, consider right-clicking on the Ubuntu icon and pinning it to your Start menu or to your Taskbar.</p>
<p>If you are running an earlier version of Windows, or an outdated version of Windows 10 that you cannot update, then you have several choices. For simpler development environments, using <a class="external" href="https://mingw.osdn.io/index.html" target="_blank">MinGW</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-111-hidden.html" title="Footnote 4.1.4"><sup> 4 </sup></a> provides a lightweight solution, so you might try this first. For a more complicated development environment such as one that utilizes virtualization, using a Virtual Machine (VM) environment such as <a class="external" href="https://www.virtualbox.org/" target="_blank">Virtual Box</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-112-hidden.html" title="Footnote 4.1.5"><sup> 5 </sup></a> and installing and running Ubuntu inside the VM is advisable. For a cloud option, see below.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_dev_shell_terms.html#li-86" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
