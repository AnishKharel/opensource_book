<li><p>First, search the web and <em class="emphasis">find sites that host OSS projects</em>. There are many. Bookmark these so that you can come back to them later.</p></li>
<li><p>Second, <em class="emphasis">browse through several of these sites</em> and find one or more projects that are interesting to you. You might be interested in projects that benefit others. You might be interested in tools that support work that you do. Or, it might be that you might find something strikes your fancy that you never considered before! Take this as an opportunity to explore broadly.</p></li>
<li><p>After you find an open source project of interest, <em class="emphasis">write a blog post about it</em>. At this point, the most important thing you can probably do is to explain why the project is interesting to you.</p></li>
