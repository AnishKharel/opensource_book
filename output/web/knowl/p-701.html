<p>Now the contributor can see what they need to do in order to get their change accepted. Luckily this is very straightforward. Where over email you may have to re-roll your series and resubmit it to the mailing list, with GitHub you simply commit to the topic branch again and push, which will automatically update the Pull Request. In <a class="external" href="ch00/_pr_final" target="_blank">Pull Request final</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-156-hidden.html" title="Footnote 5.5.11"><sup> 11 </sup></a> you can also see that the old code comment has been collapsed in the updated Pull Request, since it was made on a line that has since been changed.</p>
