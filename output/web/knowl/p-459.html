<p>A Git repository is more than just a set of files. It is also more than just a set of snapshots of files. It's a complete history of a project's development, which includes information about who made what changes, when those changes were made, and why they were made because the repository includes not only the committed snapshots of files, but also the metadata that accompanies those snapshots, such as commit messages and author information. Additionally, the repository includes information about the branches and tags that have been created to manage the development of the project.</p>
