<div class="para">Open source software differs from closed source proprietary software where only the owners and those they appoint have access to the source code because it is close-off to others. So, with closed source software, if you want to personally ascertain that a game or another piece of software that you want to download and install does not include code that will steal your data or take over your entire system, you are simply out of luck.</div>
