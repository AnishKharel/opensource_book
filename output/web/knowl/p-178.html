<p>The next term, <dfn class="terminology">copyleft</dfn> is one that you may not have heard before because it has emerged from the open source movement. It is also a very clear word play on the word copyright and suggests having "left" some of the author's "rights." And, that is indeed what it is, but don't assume that all rights have been abandoned by the author, far from it!</p>
