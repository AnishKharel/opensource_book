<p>If you wonder why some projects don't seem to use project boards, consider that in many OSS projects, there are no paid project leaders who can set goals, organize all of the issues into boards, prioritize tasks, etc. For the majority of OSS projects, there either isn't time to take manage project boards or the project is too small to derive much benefit from their use.</p>
