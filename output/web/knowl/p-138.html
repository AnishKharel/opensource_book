<p>Communication in an open-source community takes many forms, but all of these break down into two broad categories: synchronous (simultaneous, e.g. in person meetings or video conference meetings) and asynchronous (non-simultaneous, e.g. email or various kinds of messaging services). Due to the geographically-dispersed nature of most communities, most OSS communication makes heavy use of asynchronous technologies. Synchronous communications typically includes various forms of audio/video chat, which is neither convenient nor efficient for widely dispersed OSS communities. Asynchronous communications are much more varied and most OSS communities use more than one asynchronous form of communication. When a software team is made of full-time people who all work the same hours in the same office building, it is easier to have a higher proportion of synchronous discussion, but when some contributors are sleeping while others are working, it is far harder, so it is not a big surprise that nor that the vast majority of OSS communication is asynchronous.</p>
