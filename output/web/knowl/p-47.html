<p>Did you realize that open source software is so incredibly prevalent that you would be pretty hard-pressed to not be using it regularly? Android and Apple iOS very heavily dominate the global market share for cell phone operating systems. However, the <a class="external" href="https://source.android.com/" target="_blank">Android</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-17-hidden.html" title="Footnote 1.2.3"><sup> 3 </sup></a> system has more than three times as many users as Apple's iOS, and Android is open source. <a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux" target="_blank">Linux</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-18-hidden.html" title="Footnote 1.2.4"><sup> 4 </sup></a> is a family of open source operating systems that powers the majority of the webpages on the Internet. Chrome is by far the most popular brower on the planet, and while it is not fully open source,  it is built on top of a number of OSS projects, the details of which can be found by going to "chrome://credits" in the Chrome browser's URL bar. Even Apple iOS, which as mentioned above is the second most popular operating systems for cell phones, includes a lot of OSS components which are listed in "Settings &gt; General &gt; Legal and Regulatory". We will learn a lot more about open source licensing in <a href="ch_licensing.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 3: Open Source Licensing">Chapter 3</a>. So, OSS matters to everyone who uses a cell phone or searches the Internet. In fact, these are just examples, virtually any piece of software that the reader is using will likely include OSS components, so OSS should matter to <em class="emphasis">you</em>!</p>
