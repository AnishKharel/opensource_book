<p>As you have learned from this section, Git provides several tools for undoing changes that you have made. One of the most common undos is when you commit too early and forget to add some files, or you mess up your commit message or if you accidentally stage a file that you didn't mean to. However, it's important to be careful when using these commands because you can't always undo some of these undos.</p>
