<p>One sentence stands out: “Check the bug tracker first; your bug may be already there.” So she goes to the Inkscape bug tracker and searches for “crash”, and finds a ton of bugs — seems like software crashes a lot! She tries a few more search terms (like “copy” and “paste”), and the number of bugs she has to look through starts to drop. Alice’s search through the bugs uncovers a great deal that she doesn’t quite understand… until she finds a bug that looks almost exactly like her bug! She sees some comments on the bug that say things like “I’ve confirmed this on my Ubuntu system” and so on — so she creates an account for the Inkscape bug tracker, and adds her comment, confirming that she, too, has experienced this bug on her Mac Powerbook. Two months later, she receives an email that the latest version will contain a fix.</p>
