<p>Compilation transforms a high-level language into a low-level language like machine code or byte code. Decompilation is the reverse. The process of reverse engineering a program from its binary code to source code is called <dfn class="terminology">decompiling</dfn>, and the level of difficulty of decompiling a program differs rather significantly by the programming language of the source code. C code is notoriously difficult to decompile, while Java is much easier, partly because of far fewer compiler optimizations and partly because the intact metadata including such details as data types and method names.</p>
