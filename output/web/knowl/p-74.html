<div class="para">Note that copyright law generally provides the copyright holder with a set of exclusive rights. Decompilation is carried out by making copies of the software program, and so to be in compliance with law, one must consider the copyright before undertaking decompilation. Laws in both the United States and Europe do permit decompilation to a limited extent and for limited specific purposes. Laws in other areas of the world will vary, but reverse engineering a program for the purpose of reselling it under a different name and license would likely open you up to legal battles â€“ the authors of this text strongly caution you against such action.</div>
