<section class="paragraphs"><h5 class="heading"><span class="title">Keeping up with Upstream.</span></h5>  <div class="para">If your Pull Request becomes out of date or otherwise doesn’t merge cleanly, you will want to fix it so the maintainer can easily merge it. GitHub will test this for you and let you know at the bottom of every Pull Request if the merge is trivial or not.</div>  <div class="para">If your Pull Request does not merge cleanly you’ll want to fix your branch so that it turns green.</div>  <div class="para">You have two main options in order to do this. You can either rebase your branch on top of whatever the target branch is (normally the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">main</code> branch of the repository you forked), or you can merge the target branch into your branch.</div>  <div class="para">Most developers on GitHub will choose to do the latter, for the same reasons we just went over in the previous section. What matters is the history and the final merge, so rebasing isn’t getting you much other than a slightly cleaner history and in return is <dfn class="terminology">far</dfn> more difficult and error prone.</div>  <div class="para">If you want to merge in the target branch to make your Pull Request mergeable, you would add the original repository as a new remote, fetch from it, merge the main branch of that repository into your topic branch, fix any issues and finally push it back up to the same branch you opened the Pull Request on.</div>  <div class="para logical"><ol class="decimal">
<li><div class="para">Add the original repository as a remote named <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">upstream</code>.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Fetch the newest work from that remote.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Merge the main branch of that repository into your topic branch.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Fix the conflict that occurred.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Push back up to the same topic branch.</div></li>
</ol></div>  <div class="para">Once you do that, the Pull Request will be automatically updated and re-checked to see if it merges cleanly.</div>  <div class="para">One of the great things about Git is that you can do that continuously. If you have a very long-running project, you can easily merge from the target branch over and over again and only have to deal with conflicts that have arisen since the last time that you merged, making the process very manageable.</div>  <div class="para">If you absolutely wish to rebase the branch to clean it up, you can certainly do so, but it is highly encouraged to not force push over the branch that the Pull Request is already opened on. If other people have pulled it down and done more work on it, you will run into major problems! Instead, push the rebased branch to a new branch on GitHub and open a brand new Pull Request referencing the old one, then close the original.</div> </section><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_git_github.html#_keeping_up_with_upstream" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
