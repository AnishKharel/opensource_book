<section class="paragraphs"><h6 class="heading"><span class="title">Email Notifications.</span></h6>  <div class="para">Email notifications are the other way you can handle notifications through GitHub. If you have this turned on you will get emails for each notification. The emails will also be threaded properly, which is nice if you’re using a threading email client.</div>  <div class="para">There is also a fair amount of metadata embedded in the headers of the emails that GitHub sends you, which can be really helpful for setting up custom filters and rules.</div>  <div class="para">There are a couple of interesting things here. If you want to highlight or re-route emails to this particular project or even Pull Request, the information in <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">Message-ID</code> gives you all the data in <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">&lt;user&gt;/&lt;project&gt;/&lt;type&gt;/&lt;id&gt;</code> format. If this were an issue, for example, the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">&lt;type&gt;</code> field would have been “issues” rather than “pull”.</div>  <div class="para">The <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">List-Post</code> and <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">List-Unsubscribe</code> fields mean that if you have a mail client that understands those, you can easily post to the list or “Unsubscribe” from the thread. That would be essentially the same as clicking the “mute” button on the web version of the notification or “Unsubscribe” on the Issue or Pull Request page itself.</div>  <div class="para">It’s also worth noting that if you have both email and web notifications enabled and you read the email version of the notification, the web version will be marked as read as well if you have images allowed in your mail client.</div> </section><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_git_github.html#_email_notifications_2" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
