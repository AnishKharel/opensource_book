<div class="para">There are definite advantages to keeping source code hidden, especially if your goal is to sell the software itself. It’s harder to sell a software program when anyone is free to take the source code and use it for any purpose. If Microsoft were to release the Windows source code under an open source software license, anyone would then be able to take that source code, build “Bob’s Own Operating System,” maybe make a few changes, and then re-sell that product as a competitor to Microsoft Windows. Obviously, most companies who are selling commercial software don’t want that to happen.</div>
