<section class="paragraphs"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title"><dfn class="terminology">What is a Bug Tracker, Exactly?</dfn></span></h4>
<p>A bug tracker for a open source project is a web application that allows users to enter bug reports about a software project. These bug reports then go into a database, where they can be tracked and managed as the developers work to fix them.</p>
<p>There are many different bug trackers available for use by open source projects. Most of them collect very similar information:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p><em class="emphasis">Summary,</em> a short description of the bug. For example: “Toaster always burns toast”. This short phrase is usually what the developer sees in his or her list of bugs.</p></li>
<li><p><em class="emphasis">Description,</em> a more detailed description of the bug, ideally with lots of clues. This is where the reporter explains what he or she was doing, what was expected to happen, and what happened instead. For example, “I have a BreadNuke toaster model XZ-38, and it never works. I expect it to brown my toast nicely; but it always burns my toast instead. I’ve tried setting the knob from 0 to 9, and the toast always comes out completely black!”</p></li>
<li><p><em class="emphasis">Comments,</em> which allow other users or developers to add information to the bug. For example, a user might say “it burns my toast too!” Or, a developer might respond “the docs for the XZ-38 specify that it’s for creating Blackened Toast”. For a complex bug, there can be literally hundreds of comments attached to the bug report.</p></li>
<li><p><em class="emphasis">Reporter</em> is the email address or account name of the user who reported the bug.</p></li>
<li><p><em class="emphasis">Owner</em> is the email address or account name of the developer assigned to fix the bug.</p></li>
<li><p><em class="emphasis">Version</em>. When there are multiple versions of the software, it’s obviously important to know which version the bug appears in.</p></li>
<li><p><em class="emphasis">Severity</em> and <em class="emphasis">Priority</em>. Severity, usually set initially by the user, indicates the impact that a bug has. Priority, usually set initially by the developer, indicates which bugs receive attention first. In practice, these two can be confusing, and sometimes a project chooses to pay attention to only one of them.</p></li>
<li><p><em class="emphasis">Status</em>, which describes the state a bug is in. Bugs start with a <em class="emphasis">new</em> status, and then they become <em class="emphasis">assigned</em> when a developer is tasked to work on them. The ultimate goal is to move a bug’s status to <em class="emphasis">closed</em>.</p></li>
<li><p><em class="emphasis">Resolution</em>, which is particular to closed bugs. <em class="emphasis">Fixed</em> means just that: the bug was fixed.  <em class="emphasis">Nextrelease</em> indicates that a bug has been fixed, but the fix won’t be available to users until the next release of the software. Users often file bugs that aren’t actually bugs, but are the result of user error; such bugs are closed as <em class="emphasis">invalid</em> or <em class="emphasis">notabug</em>. Lots of bugs are duplicates of one another, so bugs are often closed as <em class="emphasis">duplicate</em> with a reference to a single authoritative bug report. Occasionally, a bug is just not worth the work required to close it; these bugs are closed <em class="emphasis">wontfix</em>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Because all of this data is collected in a structured way, it becomes much easier to sort through the bugs for meaningful data — which becomes essential as the project grows, and the bugs multiply.</p>
<section class="paragraphs"><h5 class="heading"><span class="title"><dfn class="terminology">Sorting Through the Bugs</dfn>.</span></h5>
<p>Much of a software developer’s life is spent fixing bugs, and there are almost always more bugs than there is time to fix those bugs — which means that having a good way of deciding which bugs are important, at any given time, is crucial.</p>
<p>All bug trackers have functionality for searching bugs by detailed criteria. Some common searches that developers might run, for instance:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>“What’s new and broken today?” Find every bug with a status of <em class="emphasis">new</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>“What should I work on first today?” Find every high priority bug assigned to the developer.</p></li>
<li><p>“What bugs did we close that should go in the notes for our upcoming release?” Find all of the bugs with the latest version, that have a status of <em class="emphasis">closed</em> and a resolution of <em class="emphasis">fixed</em> or <em class="emphasis">nextrelease</em>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>And so on.</p></section><section class="paragraphs"><h5 class="heading"><span class="title"><dfn class="terminology">Exercise – Find the Oldest Bug</dfn>.</span></h5>
<p>Find the oldest bug that’s still open in your chosen project. Write a blog entry describing the problem, with a theory about why the bug hasn’t been resolved yet. (Bonus points if you can actually resolve the bug.)</p></section><article class="exercise exercise-like"><a href="" class="exercise-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/exercise-create-your-bug-tracker-account-hidden.html" title="Checkpoint 6.1.1: Exercise – Create Your Bug Tracker Account"><h5 class="heading">
