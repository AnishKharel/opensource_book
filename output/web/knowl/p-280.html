<p>You might wonder why a folder is typically referred to as a directory in the shell. This is due to the structure and the uses of a folder and directory in the Linux OS. In the physical world, a folder is used as a container that can hold multiple documents while a directory is a type of index that allows you to look up items. In Linux, a directory does not really contain files. A directory is a special file that keeps track of the location of a file's content in memory. For this reason, it is called a directory in the shell. Hence, a directory stores the list of items, but not always the actual items themselves. Nevertheless, the terms directory and folder are used interchangeably in computing.</p>
