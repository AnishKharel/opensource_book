<p>At this point, the project owner can look at the suggested change and merge it, reject it or comment on it. Let’s say that he likes the idea, but would prefer a slightly longer time for the light to be off than on.</p>
<p>Where this conversation may take place over email in the workflows presented in <a class="external" href="ch00/ch05-distributed-git" target="_blank">Distributed Git</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-153-hidden.html" title="Footnote 5.6.9"><sup> 9 </sup></a>, on GitHub this happens online. The project owner can review the unified diff and leave a comment by clicking on any of the lines.</p>
<p>Once the maintainer makes a  comment, the person who opened the Pull Request (and indeed, anyone else watching the repository) will get a notification.</p>
<p>Note that anyone can also leave general comments on the Pull Request.</p>
<p>Now the contributor can see what they need to do in order to get their change accepted. Luckily this is very straightforward. With GitHub you simply commit to the same topic branch again and push, which will automatically update the Pull Request.</p>
<p>Adding commits to an existing Pull Request doesn’t trigger a notification, so once you push corrections you might want to to leave a comment to inform the project owner that you made the requested change.</p>
<p>An interesting thing to notice is that if you click on the “Files Changed” tab on any Pull Request, you’ll get a “unified” diff — that is, the total aggregate difference that would be introduced the main branch if this topic branch was merged in. In <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git diff</code> terms, it basically automatically shows you <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git diff main&lt;branch&gt;</code> for the branch this Pull Request is based on.</p>
<p>GitHub always checks to see if the Pull Request merges cleanly and provides a button to do the merge for you on the server. This button only shows up if you have write access to the repository and a trivial merge is possible. If you click it GitHub will perform a “non-fast-forward” merge, meaning that even if the merge <dfn class="terminology">could</dfn> be a fast-forward, it will still create a merge commit.</p>
<p>If you  prefer, you can simply pull the branch down and merge it locally. If you merge this branch into the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">main</code> branch and push it to GitHub, the Pull Request will automatically be closed.</p>
<p>This is the basic workflow that most GitHub projects use. Topic branches are created, Pull Requests are opened on them, a discussion ensues, possibly more work is done on the branch and eventually the request is either closed or merged.</p>
<p>Note: It’s important to note that you can also open a Pull Request between two branches in the same repository. If you’re working on a feature with someone and you both have write access to the project, you can push a topic branch to the repository and open a Pull Request on it to the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">main</code> branch of that same project to initiate the code review and discussion process. No forking necessary.</p></section><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_git_github.html#_iterating_on_a_pull_request" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
