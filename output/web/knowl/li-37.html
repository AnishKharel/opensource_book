<p>In recent times, collaborative instant messaging platforms like <a class="external" href="https://discord.com/" target="_blank">Discord</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-52-hidden.html" title="Footnote 2.4.19"><sup> 19 </sup></a>, <a class="external" href="https://matrix.org/" target="_blank">Matrix</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-53-hidden.html" title="Footnote 2.4.20"><sup> 20 </sup></a>, <a class="external" href="https://mattermost.com/" target="_blank">Mattermost</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-54-hidden.html" title="Footnote 2.4.21"><sup> 21 </sup></a>, <a class="external" href="https://slack.com/" target="_blank">Slack</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-55-hidden.html" title="Footnote 2.4.22"><sup> 22 </sup></a>, and others have become very heavily leveraged in OSS communities. Each of these platforms has their own flavor, and the choice of which of these to use is largely driven by the OSS community. Discord was originally favored by gamers. Matrix is decentralized, open source, offers end-to-end encryption, and is the primary choice for some larger projects like <a class="external" href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Matrix" target="_blank">Firefox</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-56-hidden.html" title="Footnote 2.4.23"><sup> 23 </sup></a>. Mattermost is also open source and is most proud of being dedicated to security, so the Mattermost website highlights users like the US Department of Defense. Slack was developed for for professional and organizational communications, and is also very heavily utilized by many OSS projects. Some commonalities across all of these collaborative instant messaging platforms is that communication is carried out in channels which individual users are placed in or choose to join.  In addition to human users, various services and <dfn class="terminology">bots</dfn> (programs providing automation) are present in many channels. Nicknames or handles are used, although in some OSS communities, the handles must adhere to the rules of the project (e.g. being identical to your handle on the project's SECP).</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_community_communication.html#li-37" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
