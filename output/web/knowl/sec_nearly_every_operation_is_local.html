<p></p>
<p>Most operations in Git need only local files and resources to operate — generally no information is needed from another computer on your network. Because you have the entire history of the project right there on your local disk, most operations seem almost instantaneous.</p>
<p>For example, to browse the history of the project, Git doesn’t need to go out to the server to get the history and display it for you — it simply reads it directly from your local repository. This means you see the project history almost instantly. If you want to see the changes introduced between the current version of a file and the file a month ago, Git can look up the file a month ago and do a local difference calculation, instead of having to either ask a remote server to do it or pull an older version of the file from the remote server to do it locally.</p>
<p>This also means that there is very little you can’t do if you’re offline. If you get on an airplane or a train and want to do a little work, you can commit happily (to your <em class="emphasis">local</em> copy, remember?) until you get to a network connection to upload.</p></section><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_git_getting_started.html#sec_nearly_every_operation_is_local" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
