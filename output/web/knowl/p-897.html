<div class="para">For software to improve over time, good issue and bug reports are absolutely essential. Users who file issues, while almost always well-meaning, frequently don’t know how to write good issue reports — which is a problem, but also an opportunity for others to make positive contributions. Turning a bad issue or bug report into a good issue or bug report doesn’t require special developer knowledge; it just requires patience, persistence, a solid understanding of how the software works, and an understanding of what good issue and bug reports look like.</div>
