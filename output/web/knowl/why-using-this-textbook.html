<section class="paragraphs"><h2 class="heading"><span class="title">Using This Book to Get Started.</span></h2> <div class="para"></div> <div class="para">This book exists because professors asked for it, but this book’s fundamental approach — teaching the basic skills of open source development incrementally, through real involvement in meaningful projects — should make it suitable for self-learners as well. Regardless of whether you are using this text as part of a course or working with it on your own, you should work through it while adhering to the principles of contributing, calling for help, and being bold.</div> <div class="para">First, always be contributing. The majority of exercises in this book are designed to lead to direct and useful contributions to a project, no matter how small. Even a simple act, such as adding comments to a part of the code you don’t understand, can add real value to a project; that’s the great thing about community developed software. Contribution matters, and legitimate contributions, no matter how small, are welcome in many projects.</div> <div class="para">Second, ask for help when you’re stuck. If you have trouble with an exercise — and at some point you will — look to your fellow contributors for help. Your chosen project likely has mechanisms for getting in touch with the more advanced developers: mailing lists, IRC channels, Slack channels, or Discourse channels, or forums, or more than one of the above. Communicating with those around you is not only “not cheating,” it’s key to establishing greater understanding. Keep this in mind, though: in the real world, people are most likely to help those who are trying to help themselves. Before you ask someone a question of more senior developers, ask the same question of Google. A good rule of thumb: if you can’t figure something out in a few hours of searching the Internet, it’s reasonable to ask for a bit of help.</div> <div class="para">And third, be bold. Try things. Break stuff. Don’t be afraid to play around with your own copy of the code; it’s only code, after all, and if you break something, you can always revert to the previous version. If you reach a point at which you think you’re ready to make a contribution of some kind, then offer to help on the project’s preferred communication channel. The answer will usually be “go ahead, thanks!” Sometimes the offer will be “no thanks, and here’s why,” and you’ll learn something. Occasionally the answer will be “no, go away,” which is also useful, since it tells you to invest your energies into another project. Sometimes the answer may be silence; don’t be afraid to keep asking until you get an answer, or even plunge ahead without one. Learn the rules of the project and follow them; if the rules of the project are vague or confusing, you can help to make them clearer. This alone can be a critical contribution, as it clearly helps those who come along after you.</div> <div class="para">In most educational contexts, you have likely been “trained” to wait for permission before doing anything not previously specified, but you must avoid letting that get in the way of your progress when engaging with an open source project. When the rules are unclear, don’t sit on your hands. Do your best to help the project. It’s better to do something wrong, and learn from it, than to do nothing at all.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a href="meta_frontmatter-forward.html#why-using-this-textbook" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
