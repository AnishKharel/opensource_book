<div class="para">
<dfn class="terminology">Issue trackers</dfn> are designed to record, track, and resolve bugs, feature requests, questions, etc. After an issue is posted, discussions on the issue typically occur and are sometimes prolonged. These discussions are most conveniently attached to the issue itself to facilitate the tracking of the discussion, which is particularly important in larger projects. When an issue is posted, it can be discussed by the community to decide on how to proceed with it. The issue can be categorized and linked to other discussions, projects, and engineering work as well. You are definitely advised to read all unresolved issues before posting so you are not duplicating another existing issue.</div>
<div class="para">A number of features exist in most issue trackers that facilitate communication among contributors and potential contributors. These include linking, labelling, mentioning a particular user, etc.</div>
<div class="para logical">
<div class="para">One important feature that exists in issue trackers is the ability to <dfn class="terminology">label</dfn> the issue with one or more of a set of labels. Github, for example, provides the following default labels:</div>
<ul class="circle">
<li><div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">bug</em>: indicates an unexpected problem or unintended behavior.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">documentation</em>: indicates a need for improvements or additions to documentation.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">duplicate</em>: indicates similar issues, pull requests, or discussions. These related items are then typically linked for convenience.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">enhancement</em>: indicates new feature requests.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">good first issue</em>: indicates a good issue for first-time contributors. <em class="emphasis">The mere presence of this label indicates an openness to new contributors, so this is a very important label to look for when you are a potential new contributor.</em>
</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">help wanted</em>: indicates that a maintainer wants help on an issue or pull request.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">invalid</em>: indicates that an issue, pull request, or discussion is no longer relevant.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">question</em>: indicates that an issue, pull request, or discussion needs more information.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">
<em class="emphasis">wontfix</em>: indicates that work wonâ€™t continue on an issue, pull request, or discussion.</div></li>
</ul>
<div class="para">Note that although the above default labels are included in every new Github repository, maintainers may or may not use all of them, and many maintainers choose to edit or delete some of the default labels and/or add their own custom labels that make sense for that project.</div>
