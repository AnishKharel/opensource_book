</h4>
<p>Issue trackers were originally designed to record, track, and resolve user-encountered issues including bugs. However, issue trackers are also often used by users to submit feature-requests.</p>
<p>When an issue is posted, short discussions on the issue often occur. These discussions are most conveniently attached to the issue itself to facilitate the tracking of the discussion, which is particularly important in larger projects.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_community_communication.html#li-33" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
