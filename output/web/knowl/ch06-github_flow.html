<section class="paragraphs"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">The GitHub Flow.</span></h4>
<p>GitHub is designed around a particular collaboration workflow, centered on Pull Requests. This flow works whether you’re collaborating with a tightly-knit team in a single shared repository, or a globally-distributed company or network of strangers contributing to a project through dozens of forks. It is centered on the <a class="external" href="ch00/_topic_branch" target="_blank">Topic Branches</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-119-hidden.html" title="Footnote 5.4.5"><sup> 5 </sup></a> workflow covered in <a class="external" href="ch00/ch03-git-branching" target="_blank">Git Branching</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-120-hidden.html" title="Footnote 5.4.6"><sup> 6 </sup></a>.</p>
<p>Here’s how it generally works:</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>Fork the project.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a topic branch from <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">master</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Make some commits to improve the project.</p></li>
<li><p>Push this branch to your GitHub project.</p></li>
<li><p>Open a Pull Request on GitHub.</p></li>
<li><p>Discuss, and optionally continue committing.</p></li>
<li><p>The project owner merges or closes the Pull Request.</p></li>
<li><p>Sync the updated master back to your fork.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This is basically the Integration Manager workflow covered in <a class="external" href="ch00/_integration_manager" target="_blank">Integration-Manager Workflow</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-121-hidden.html" title="Footnote 5.4.7"><sup> 7 </sup></a>, but instead of using email to communicate and review changes, teams use GitHub’s web based tools.</p>
<p>Let’s walk through an example of proposing a change to an open source project hosted on GitHub using this flow.</p>
<p>Note: You can use the official <dfn class="terminology">GitHub CLI</dfn> tool instead of the GitHub web interface for most things. The tool can be used on Windows, MacOS, and Linux systems. Go to the <a class="external" href="https://cli.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub CLI homepage</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-122-hidden.html" title="Footnote 5.4.8"><sup> 8 </sup></a> for installation instructions and the manual.</p>

<p>Tony is looking for code to run on his Arduino programmable microcontroller and has found a great program file on GitHub at <a class="external" href="https://github.com/schacon/blink" target="_blank">https://github.com/schacon/blink</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-123-hidden.html" title="Footnote 5.4.9"><sup> 9 </sup></a>.</p>

We think it’s much nicer to wait 3 seconds instead of 1 in between each state change. So let’s improve the program and submit it back to the project as a proposed change.</p>
<p>First, we click the 'Fork' button as mentioned earlier to get our own copy of the project. Our user name here is “tonychacon” so our copy of this project is at <a class="external" href="https://github.com/tonychacon/blink" target="_blank"><code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">https://github.com/tonychacon/blink</code></a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-124-hidden.html" title="Footnote 5.4.10"><sup> 10 </sup></a> and that’s where we can edit it. We will clone it locally, create a topic branch, make the code change and finally push that change back up to GitHub.</p>

</ol>
<p>Now if we go back to our fork on GitHub, we can see that GitHub noticed that we pushed a new topic branch up and presents us with a big green button to check out our changes and open a Pull Request to the original project.</p>
<p>You can alternatively go to the “Branches” page at <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">https://github.com/&lt;user&gt;/&lt;project&gt;/branches</code> to locate your branch and open a new Pull Request from there.</p>

It is almost always worthwhile to put some effort into this, since a good description helps the owner of the original project determine what you were trying to do, whether your proposed changes are correct, and whether accepting the changes would improve the original project.</p>
<p>We also see a list of the commits in our topic branch that are “ahead” of the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">master</code> branch (in this case, just the one) and a unified diff of all the changes that will be made should this branch get merged by the project owner.</p>
<figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 100%; margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%;"><img src="external/github-blink-03-pull-request-open.png" class="contained"></div>
<figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">5.4.11<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span>Pull Request creation page</figcaption></figure><p>When you hit the 'Create pull request' button on this screen, the owner of the project you forked will get a notification that someone is suggesting a change and will link to a page that has all of this information on it.</p>
<p>Note: Though Pull Requests are used commonly for public projects like this when the contributor has a complete change ready to be made, it’s also often used in internal projects <em class="emphasis">at the beginning</em> of the development cycle. Since you can keep pushing to the topic branch even <dfn class="terminology">after</dfn> the Pull Request is opened, it’s often opened early and used as a way to iterate on work as a team within a context, rather than opened at the very end of the process.</p></section><section class="paragraphs"><h5 class="heading"><span class="title">Iterating on a Pull Request.</span></h5>
<p>At this point, the project owner can look at the suggested change and merge it, reject it or comment on it. Let’s say that he likes the idea, but would prefer a slightly longer time for the light to be off than on.</p>
<p>Where this conversation may take place over email in the workflows presented in <a class="external" href="ch00/ch05-distributed-git" target="_blank">Distributed Git</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-125-hidden.html" title="Footnote 5.4.11"><sup> 11 </sup></a>, on GitHub this happens online. The project owner can review the unified diff and leave a comment by clicking on any of the lines.</p>
<figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 100%; margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%;"><img src="external/github-blink-04-pr-comment.png" class="contained"></div>
<figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">5.4.12<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span>Comment on a specific line of code in a Pull Request</figcaption></figure><p>Once the maintainer makes this comment, the person who opened the Pull Request (and indeed, anyone else watching the repository) will get a notification. We’ll go over customizing this later, but if he had email notifications turned on, Tony would get an email like this:</p>
<figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 100%; margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%;"><img src="external/github-blink-04-email.png" class="contained"></div>
<figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">5.4.13<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span>Comments sent as email notifications</figcaption></figure><p>Anyone can also leave general comments on the Pull Request. In <a class="external" href="ch00/_pr_discussion" target="_blank">Pull Request discussion page</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-126-hidden.html" title="Footnote 5.4.12"><sup> 12 </sup></a> we can see an example of the project owner both commenting on a line of code and then leaving a general comment in the discussion section. You can see that the code comments are brought into the conversation as well.</p>
<figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 100%; margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%;"><img src="external/github-blink-05-general-comment.png" class="contained"></div>
<figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">5.4.14<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span>Pull Request discussion page</figcaption></figure><p>Now the contributor can see what they need to do in order to get their change accepted. Luckily this is very straightforward. Where over email you may have to re-roll your series and resubmit it to the mailing list, with GitHub you simply commit to the topic branch again and push, which will automatically update the Pull Request. In <a class="external" href="ch00/_pr_final" target="_blank">Pull Request final</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-127-hidden.html" title="Footnote 5.4.13"><sup> 13 </sup></a> you can also see that the old code comment has been collapsed in the updated Pull Request, since it was made on a line that has since been changed.</p>
<p>Adding commits to an existing Pull Request doesn’t trigger a notification, so once Tony has pushed his corrections he decides to leave a comment to inform the project owner that he made the requested change.</p>
<figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 100%; margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%;"><img src="external/github-blink-06-final.png" class="contained"></div>
<figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">5.4.15<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span>Pull Request final</figcaption></figure><p>An interesting thing to notice is that if you click on the “Files Changed” tab on this Pull Request, you’ll get the “unified” diff — that is, the total aggregate difference that would be introduced to your main branch if this topic branch was merged in. In <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git diff</code> terms, it basically automatically shows you <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git diff master…​&lt;branch&gt;</code> for the branch this Pull Request is based on. See <a class="external" href="ch00/_what_is_introduced" target="_blank">Determining What Is Introduced</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-128-hidden.html" title="Footnote 5.4.14"><sup> 14 </sup></a> for more about this type of diff.</p>
<p>The other thing you’ll notice is that GitHub checks to see if the Pull Request merges cleanly and provides a button to do the merge for you on the server. This button only shows up if you have write access to the repository and a trivial merge is possible. If you click it GitHub will perform a “non-fast-forward” merge, meaning that even if the merge <dfn class="terminology">could</dfn> be a fast-forward, it will still create a merge commit.</p>
<p>If you would prefer, you can simply pull the branch down and merge it locally. If you merge this branch into the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">master</code> branch and push it to GitHub, the Pull Request will automatically be closed.</p>
<p>This is the basic workflow that most GitHub projects use. Topic branches are created, Pull Requests are opened on them, a discussion ensues, possibly more work is done on the branch and eventually the request is either closed or merged.</p>
<p>Note: It’s important to note that you can also open a Pull Request between two branches in the same repository. If you’re working on a feature with someone and you both have write access to the project, you can push a topic branch to the repository and open a Pull Request on it to the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">master</code> branch of that same project to initiate the code review and discussion process. No forking necessary.</p></section></section><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_git_github.html#ch06-github_flow" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
