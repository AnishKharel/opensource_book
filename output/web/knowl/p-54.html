<div class="para">Without OSS, getting experience in real software projects requires access, and probably permission, to see the source code. For students, that access is usually limited to those who can get <em class="emphasis">internships</em> or positions in <em class="emphasis">co-op </em>programs. Not everyone has the opportunity to spend the summer interning with a company that does large-scale software development, meaning that too few students have the opportunity to work with large (proprietary/closed) code-bases. And even if they do, those students typically cannot show their work to anyone outside of the sponsoring company, and they sometimes cannot even discuss that work.</div>
