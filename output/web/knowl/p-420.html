<p>However, centralized VCSs also have some serious downsides. Conflict resolution can be a challenge because if individual copies of the repository diverge significantly from one another, conflicts can arise when merging changes is attempted. This lead to a process of resolving the conflicts, which can be time-consuming even when using conflict resolution tools. In fact, resolution of conflicts can delay the development process. To mitigate this, developers must communicate regarding direction and must also synchronize copies of the codebase regularly by merging changes  often. Effective communication and frequent updating can help prevent significant divergence and reduce the risk of conflicts in centralized VCSs.</p>
