</h3> Knowledge-level can be tied up in ego. When you are new to any community, you are a novice on the culture of that community even if you are an expert in some of the tools and languages used by that community. As you endeavor to become a new member of an open source community, it is good to remember that you are a novice to the culture. Some good advice is to read the contribution guide (if the project has one), read the community discussions such as in relevant discussion forums and in bug reports. If you first try to get a sense of how the community operates before you violate any implicit or explicit rules, you are much more likely to be welcomed in. For example, it could be frustrating to try to maintain code quality with volunteer contributors who are happy to contribute but who have not tried to understand the existing standards (such as formatting, documentation, or tests).</article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_community_global.html#li-21" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
