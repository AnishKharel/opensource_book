<div class="para">You likely know that an electronic mailing list is a collection of names and email addresses used to send material to multiple recipients typically given a single email address for the list. Open source communities that use email lists tend to use discussion lists (which allow for replies) rather than announcement lists (which are one way) to engage their communities. An example of an open source project that leverages email lists heavily for discussions is <a class="external" href="https://www.debian.org/MailingLists/" target="_blank">Debian</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-57-hidden.html" title="Footnote 2.4.24"><sup> 24 </sup></a>. Note that all emails sent to the Debian lists are distributed both to the list subscribers as well as copied to the public archive, so people to browse or search without the need to be subscribed.</div>
<div class="para">People on an email list typically use their real name. Surprisingly, there is a significant variation from community to community in terms of list etiquette and even the amount of participation on lists.</div>
<div class="para">An open-source participant subscribed to several lists in multiple communities can easily receive thousands of messages a day. For this reason, many people choose to use a separate mailbox or use filtering rules to keep their mail under control or sign up to receive only a regular "digest" of the messages.</div>
<div class="para">Email lists are sometimes managed through online list service providers such as Google Groups, but are often managed through private installations of list management software such as the open source <a class="external" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/mailman/" target="_blank">GNU Mailman</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-58-hidden.html" title="Footnote 2.4.25"><sup> 25 </sup></a>, which provide subscriber management, bounce control, and web-accessible archiving.</div>
<div class="para">Web-based forums have some similarities to email lists because users can subscribe to receive updates via email. However, conversations in forums are typically grouped by discussion topic and are often better-organized than email archives, which makes them easier to browse and search. People on a  forum typically have handles or nicknames, rarely using their full real name, unlike in email. Many OSS communities have one or more forums specific to various aspects of the project. There are also forums that span multiple OSS communities. For example, <a class="external" href="https://itsfoss.community/" target="_blank">It’s FOSS Community</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-59-hidden.html" title="Footnote 2.4.26"><sup> 26 </sup></a> is an example of an active forum on FOSS.</div>
<div class="para">Other OSS communities use related communication technologies such as newsgroups and listservs which serve some of the same purposes as mailing lists and forums and often offer e-mail notifications as well.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_community_communication.html#li-49" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
