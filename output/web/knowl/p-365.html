<p>This means you have a clean working directory; in other words, none of your tracked files are modified. Git also doesn’t see any untracked files, or they would be listed here. Finally, the command tells you which branch you’re on and informs you that it has not diverged from the same branch on the server. For now, that branch is always <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">master</code>, which is the default; you won’t worry about it here.  The next section on Git Branching will go over branches and references in detail.</p>
