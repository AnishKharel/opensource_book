<p>A useful GitHub specific Markdown feature, especially for use in Pull Requests, is the <a class="external" href="https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-tasklists" target="_blank">Task List</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-152-hidden.html" title="Footnote 5.6.10"><sup> 10 </sup></a>. A <dfn class="terminology">task list</dfn> is a list of checkboxes of things you want to get done. Putting them into an Issue or Pull Request normally indicates things that you want to get done before you consider the item complete.</p>
<p>These are often used in Pull Requests to indicate what all you would like to get done on the branch before the Pull Request will be ready to merge. The really cool part is that you can simply click the checkboxes to update the comment — you don’t have to edit the Markdown directly to check tasks off.</p>
<p>What’s more, GitHub will look for task lists in your Issues and Pull Requests and show them as metadata on the pages that list them out. For example, if you have a Pull Request with tasks and you look at the overview page of all Pull Requests, you can see how far done it is. This helps people break down Pull Requests into subtasks and helps other people track the progress of the branch.</p>
<p>These are incredibly useful when you open a Pull Request early and use it to track your progress through the implementation of the feature.</p></section><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_git_github.html#_task_lists" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
