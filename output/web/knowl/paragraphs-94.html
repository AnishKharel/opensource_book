<p>It’s easy to provide way too much of this kind of information, but that’s a forgivable sin: it’s certainly better than providing none at all, which is too frequently the case. Over time, you develop a feel for which information to provide — and if you become a trusted contributor to a project, developers feel more comfortable asking for precisely the information they need. Until developers say otherwise, it’s usually best to err on the side of providing too much info. (Within reason. Dumping the entire contents of gigantic log files into a bug report is clearly bad form, but a relevant log file may be attached to a bug report.)</p></section><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_bug_reports.html#paragraphs-94" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
