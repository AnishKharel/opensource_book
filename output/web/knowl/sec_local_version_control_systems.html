<section class="paragraphs"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Local VCSs.</span></h4> <div class="para"></div> <div class="para">Many people’s first personal version-control method of choice is an informal one such as copying files into another directory or up into the cloud. These informal approaches are common because they are simple, but they are also  error prone. It is easy to forget which directory you’re in and accidentally write to the wrong file or copy over files you don’t mean to.</div> <div class="para">To deal with this issue, programmers long ago developed a more formal system of version control.  Local VCSs provide a more automatic, less error-prone and more structured way of keeping all the changes to files under revision control on the local computer. Local VCSs typically operate quickly because they do not have to communicate with a remote server. With a local system, developers have access to the entire history of the codebase on their local machine, and they can work on the codebase offline, without an internet connection.</div> <div class="para">However, there are significant disadvantages to using local VCSs. For example, local VCSs do not support collaboration because multiple developers cannot easily work on the same codebase at the same time. So. local VCSs are more suited for individual developers who are working on their own projects. Local VCSs store code data locally, which increases the risk of data loss due to machine failure or corruption because whenever you have the entire history of a project in a single place, you risk losing everything. In addition, local systems are not scalable, so as the codebase grows in size, the performance of the local system may degrade.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_git_getting_started.html#sec_local_version_control_systems" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
