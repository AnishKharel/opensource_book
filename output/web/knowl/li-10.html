<dfn class="terminology">Users can fix their own bugs</dfn>. This is not a freedom that is obviously useful to everybody. Not every software user is knowledgeable enough to fix a bug when they find it. That’s fine; FOSS also means that users can find other people to fix their bugs for them. Not everybody who owns a car is competent to change their own oil, but the freedom to change your oil, or fix a flat tire, or rebuild your own brakes — or the freedom to be able to go to any mechanic or any mechanically inclined friend and ask them to do it for you — is a crucial freedom to car owners. FOSS extends that freedom to software.</article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_share_code.html#li-10" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
