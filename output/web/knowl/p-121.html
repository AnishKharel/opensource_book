<p>The term open source is broadly applied, but there are many different types and degrees of openness. Some projects are open in a lob-the-software-over-the-wall sense: the code has been released under an open source license, but no community has formed around it; periodically, a new source tarball comes flying over the wall to play with, and it’s not obvious how to contribute improvements back to the main source of the code — or if it’s even possible at all. Some projects have an active community but a strict management hierarchy anchored by a dictator-for-life or impenetrable core committee, while others have an openness that extends to their management structure. There are also projects where the core source code is tightly controlled, but are extremely open in peripheral areas such translations, documentation, and community support.</p>
