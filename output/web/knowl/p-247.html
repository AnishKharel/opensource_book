<p>Regardless of whether you are using macOS, Linux, or Windows, you are able to set up a development environment, open a terminal, and access a shell. Some good news is that all of these OSs offer shells that are largely compatible. This is useful for a variety of reasons,including being able to find find a useful answer when searching on how to accomplish various tasks on the Internet.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">On a Mac.</span></span><p>If you are on a Mac, you have a couple of good options. With any Mac, the built-in <em class="emphasis">Terminal</em> program allows you to access a shell.  If you are looking for a more customizable and feature-rich terminal program, then you might want to consider <a class="external" href="https://iterm2.com/downloads.html" target="_blank">iTerm2</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-108-hidden.html" title="Footnote 4.1.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a>. Opening the Terminal on a Mac works like opening any other program: you can find it in the Applications folder, you can search for it, you can use the Launchpad, or you can use it's shortcut which is command(⌘)+T.</p>
</li>
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">On a Linux machine.</span></span><p>On a machine running Linux, the terminal is often also called the <em class="emphasis">Terminal</em>, although depending upon the Linux environment, the name may differ. <em class="emphasis">Konsole</em> may also be used. Regardless of what it is called, you can typically access the terminal in several ways: search for the keyword Terminal, right-click  on your desktop and then select "Open Terminal", or use the shortcut Ctrl+Alt+T.</p>
</li>
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">On a Windows machine.</span></span><p>If you are on a Windows machine, you have a number of options. On Windows, the terminal/shell is historically called the <dfn class="terminology">command prompt (cmd)</dfn>, although a newer very different terminal/shell called <dfn class="terminology">PowerShell</dfn> has also been around for decades. Neither of these terminal/shells are compatible with the default shell programs available on macOS and Linux. For OSS development, it will be preferable to have access to a shell that is compatible with the macOS and Linux ones.</p>
<p>If you are running Windows 10 or Windows 11, then following the directions from Microsoft on <a class="external" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install" target="_blank">Installing Linux on Windows with WSL2</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-109-hidden.html" title="Footnote 4.1.2"><sup> 2 </sup></a> will give you the best experience. Note that you may first need to update your version of Windows, see <a class="external" href="https://bit.ly/Windows-Update-FAQ" target="_blank"><code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">https://bit.ly/Windows-Update-FAQ</code></a>. WSL2 provides a full Linux kernel that is integrated into the Windows operating system. Installing <a class="external" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/install" target="_blank">the Windows Terminal</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-110-hidden.html" title="Footnote 4.1.3"><sup> 3 </sup></a> will further enhance your experience, although it is not strictly necessary. Once you have followed the linked directions to install WSL2, including the installation of Linux (Ubuntu is a good choice),  then the shell is most easily accessed by searching for Ubuntu in the search tool next to the Windows Icon and selecting it when you see it. For convenience, consider right-clicking on the Ubuntu icon and pinning it to your Start menu or to your Taskbar.</p>
<p>If you are running an earlier version of Windows, or an outdated version of Windows 10 that you cannot update, then you have several choices. For simpler development environments, using <a class="external" href="https://mingw.osdn.io/index.html" target="_blank">MinGW</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-111-hidden.html" title="Footnote 4.1.4"><sup> 4 </sup></a> provides a lightweight solution, so you might try this first. For a more complicated development environment such as one that utilizes virtualization, using a Virtual Machine (VM) environment such as <a class="external" href="https://www.virtualbox.org/" target="_blank">Virtual Box</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-112-hidden.html" title="Footnote 4.1.5"><sup> 5 </sup></a> and installing and running Ubuntu inside the VM is advisable. For a cloud option, see below.</p>
</li>
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">Another OS.</span></span><p>Although Linux, Mac, and Windows (to a lesser extent) are by far the most typical OSs, developing in another OS environment might also be possible. For example, searching the Internet on "software development in ChromeOS" will provide several useful links for how to set up a development environment in ChromeOS. Just be aware that developing in an OS environment other than Linux, Mac, or a modern version of Windows is likely to offer little in the way of support, so you might be better off using a cloud-based development environment or a virtual machine (VM) environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">Installing Linux in a Virtual Machine (VM) Environment.</span></span><p>If you have sufficient RAM and secondary storage available, then you might consider installing Linux in a VM. This may be a particularly good choice if you are on an older Windows machine and want to develop off-line. such as <a class="external" href="https://www.virtualbox.org/" target="_blank">Virtual Box</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-113-hidden.html" title="Footnote 4.1.6"><sup> 6 </sup></a> and installing and running Ubuntu in the VM.</p>
</li>
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">In the Cloud.</span></span><p>To contribute to most open source projects, you will need to set-up a build environment for local testing. While it is typical to have a local development environment to work in, there has recently been an influx of cloud providers which offer solutions for cloud-based development environments. These have the benefit that they require less setup than a local development environment, but are often only free within constraints and otherwise incur a monthly fee, which might be waived for a trial period or for students.</p>
<p><dfn class="terminology">Cloud Development Environments (CDEs)</dfn> are full development environments in the cloud. The best known and most feature-rich is <a class="external" href="https://github.com/features/codespaces" target="_blank">GitHub Codespaces.</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-114-hidden.html" title="Footnote 4.1.7"><sup> 7 </sup></a> A couple of the other popular cloud development environments include <a class="external" href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/" target="_blank">AWS Cloud9</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-115-hidden.html" title="Footnote 4.1.8"><sup> 8 </sup></a> and <a class="external" href="https://www.gitpod.io/" target="_blank">Gitpod.</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-116-hidden.html" title="Footnote 4.1.9"><sup> 9 </sup></a> All of these environments try to help you set up your development environment with ease, and you can mostly likely find a way to at least try them for free.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this chapter, if you cannot quickly set up your local environment or cloud environment, you can practice using a shell at Fabrice Bellard's <a class="external" href="https://bellard.org/jslinux/" target="_blank">JSLinux</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-117-hidden.html" title="Footnote 4.1.10"><sup> 10 </sup></a> which provides a very small cloud-based virtual machine environment. (Choosing the riscv64 Linux console will work for all of these exercises.) Note that this a free service which has a capped bandwidth of 40 kB/s. You are asked to please be respectful and don't abuse the service.</p>
