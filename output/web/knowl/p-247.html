<p>One question you might have is whether you can use your existing machine to contribute to open source. The good news is that whether you are using Mac OS, Linux, or Windows you should be able to set up a development environment, open a terminal, and access an appropriate shell.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">On a Mac.</span></span><p>If you are on a Mac, you will need to run the <em class="emphasis">Terminal</em> program to access a shell.  Opening the Terminal on a Mac works like opening any other program: you can find it in the Applications folder, you can search for it, you can use the Launchpad, or you can use it's shortcut which is command(⌘)+T.</p>
</li>
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">In Linux.</span></span><p>In Linux, the terminal is also called the <em class="emphasis">Terminal</em>. You can access it in several ways: search for the keyword Terminal, right-click  on your desktop and then select "Open Terminal", or use the shortcut Ctrl+Alt+T.</p>
</li>
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">In Windows.</span></span><p>If you are on a Windows machine, getting to an appropriate shell is a bit more complicated. While one can use PowerShell, it is not the typical way to develop in Windows, and technical differences are likely to cause you headaches. The recommended way to develop in Windows is to use a Linux shell. If you are running Windows 11 or Windows 10 version 2004 or higher, then following the directions from Microsoft on <a class="external" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install" target="_blank">Installing Linux on Windows with WSL2</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-108-hidden.html" title="Footnote 4.1.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a> will give you the best experience. Note that you may first need to update your Windows OS, see <a class="external" href="https://bit.ly/Windows-Update-FAQ" target="_blank"><code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">https://bit.ly/Windows-Update-FAQ</code></a>. WSL2 provides a full Linux kernel that is integrated into the Windows operating system. Installing <a class="external" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/install" target="_blank">the Windows Terminal</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-109-hidden.html" title="Footnote 4.1.2"><sup> 2 </sup></a> will further enhance your experience, although it is not strictly necessary. Once you have followed the linked directions to install WSL2, including the installation of Linux (Ubuntu is a good choice),  then the shell is most easily accessed by searching for Ubuntu in the search tool next to the Windows Icon and selecting it when you see it. For convenience, consider right-clicking on the Ubuntu icon and pinning it to your Start menu or to your Taskbar.</p>
<p>If you are running an earlier version of Windows and cannot upgrade to Windows 10 version 2004 or higher, then using a Virtual Machine (VM) environment such as <a class="external" href="https://www.virtualbox.org/" target="_blank">Virtual Box</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-110-hidden.html" title="Footnote 4.1.3"><sup> 3 </sup></a> and installing and running Ubuntu inside the VM is highly advisable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">Another OS.</span></span><p>Although Linux, Mac, and Windows (to a lesser extent) are by far the most typical development environments, developing in another OS environment might also be possible. For example, searching the Internet on "software development in ChromeOS" will provide several useful links for how to set up a development environment in ChromeOS. Just be aware that developing in an OS environment other than Linux, Mac, or a modern version of Windows is likely to offer little in the way of support, so you might be better off using a Virtual Machine (VM) environment such as <a class="external" href="https://www.virtualbox.org/" target="_blank">Virtual Box</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-111-hidden.html" title="Footnote 4.1.4"><sup> 4 </sup></a> and installing and running Ubuntu in the VM.</p>
</li>
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">In the Cloud.</span></span><p>To contribute to most open source projects, you will need to set-up a build environment for local testing. White it is typical to install this on a local machine, it can be done in the cloud for a small monthly fee. More about this later. For the purposes of this chapter, if you cannot quickly set up your local environment, you can practice using a shell at Fabrice Bellard's <a class="external" href="https://bellard.org/jslinux/" target="_blank">JSLinux</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-112-hidden.html" title="Footnote 4.1.5"><sup> 5 </sup></a> which provides a very small cloud-based virtual machine environment. (Choosing the riscv64 Linux console will work for all of these exercises.) Note that this a free service which has a capped bandwidth of 40 kB/s. You are asked to please be respectful and don't abuse the service.</p>
