<p>If a particular version of a file is in the Git directory, it’s considered <em class="emphasis">committed</em>. If it has been modified and was added to the staging area, it is <em class="emphasis">staged</em>. And if it was changed since it was checked out but has not been staged, it is <em class="emphasis">modified</em>. In Git Basics you’ll learn more about these states and how you can either take advantage of them or skip the staged part entirely.</p>
