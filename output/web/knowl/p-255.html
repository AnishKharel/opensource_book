<p>To contribute to most open source projects, you will need to set-up a build environment for local testing. While it is typical to have a local development environment to work in, there has recently been an influx of cloud providers which offer solutions for cloud-based development environments. These have the benefit that they require less setup than a local development environment, but are often only free within constraints and otherwise incur a monthly fee, which might be waived for a trial period or for students.</p>
