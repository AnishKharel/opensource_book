<p>What do you think of when you think of documentation in OSS. Do you think of the README or LICENSE or CODE_OF_CONDUCT or other typical files often found in the root of the main code repository? Do you think of docstrings or other comments in the codebase itself? Do you think of user manuals? Do you think of release notes or other documentation accompanying specific versions of the software? If you do, then you are on the right track, but documentation in a typical OSS project often includes much more.</p>
