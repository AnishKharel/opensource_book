<dfn class="terminology">Virtualization</dfn> is a technique that allows for one or more virtual (or simulated) environments to run on a given physical hardware system. Virtualization refers to the creation of virtual versions of system resources, such as operating systems, CPU cores, memory, storage devices, etc.  In a virtualized system, each virtualized environment shares the actual system resources while operating as if it has dedicated resources such as memory, processing power, and storage. In part, because we can create just the right environment for a given application without running into conflicts when different applications have conflicting requirements, virtualization can provide cost-savings, flexibility, and increased efficiency.</div>
