<p>To contribute to most open source projects, you will need to set-up a build environment for local testing. While it is typical to have a local development environment to work in, there has recently been an influx of cloud providers which offer solutions for cloud-based development environments. These have the benefit that they require less setup than a local development environment, but are often only free within constraints and otherwise incur a monthly fee, which might be waived for a trial period or for students.</p>
<p><dfn class="terminology">Cloud Development Environments (CDEs)</dfn> are full development environments in the cloud. The best known and most feature-rich is <a class="external" href="https://github.com/features/codespaces" target="_blank">GitHub Codespaces.</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-114-hidden.html" title="Footnote 4.1.7"><sup> 7 </sup></a> A couple of the other popular cloud development environments include <a class="external" href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/" target="_blank">AWS Cloud9</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-115-hidden.html" title="Footnote 4.1.8"><sup> 8 </sup></a> and <a class="external" href="https://www.gitpod.io/" target="_blank">Gitpod.</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-116-hidden.html" title="Footnote 4.1.9"><sup> 9 </sup></a> All of these environments try to help you set up your development environment with ease, and you can mostly likely find a way to at least try them for free.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this chapter, if you cannot quickly set up your local environment or cloud environment, you can practice using a shell at Fabrice Bellard's <a class="external" href="https://bellard.org/jslinux/" target="_blank">JSLinux</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-117-hidden.html" title="Footnote 4.1.10"><sup> 10 </sup></a> which provides a very small cloud-based virtual machine environment. (Choosing the riscv64 Linux console will work for all of these exercises.) Note that this a free service which has a capped bandwidth of 40 kB/s. You are asked to please be respectful and don't abuse the service.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_dev_shell_terms.html#li-89" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
