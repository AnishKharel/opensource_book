<section class="paragraphs"><h5 class="heading"><span class="title">The Notifications Page.</span></h5>
<p>When we mention “notifications” here with respect to GitHub, we mean a specific way that GitHub tries to get in touch with you when events happen and there are a few different ways you can configure them. If you go to the “Notification center” tab from the settings page, you can see some of the options you have.</p>
<p>The two choices are to get notifications over “Email” and over “Web” and you can choose either, neither or both for when you actively participate in things and for activity on repositories you are watching.</p>
<section class="paragraphs"><h6 class="heading"><span class="title">Web Notifications.</span></h6>
<p>Web notifications only exist on GitHub and you can only check them on GitHub. If you have this option selected in your preferences and a notification is triggered for you, you will see a small blue dot over your notifications icon at the top of your screen.</p>
<p>If you click on that, you will see a list of all the items you have been notified about, grouped by project. You can filter to the notifications of a specific project by clicking on its name in the left hand sidebar. You can also acknowledge the notification by clicking the checkmark icon next to any notification, or acknowledge <em class="emphasis">all</em> of the notifications in a project by clicking the checkmark at the top of the group. There is also a mute button next to each checkmark that you can click to not receive any further notifications on that item.</p>
<p>All of these tools are very useful for handling large numbers of notifications. Many GitHub power users will simply turn off email notifications entirely and manage all of their notifications through this screen.</p>
<section class="paragraphs"><h6 class="heading"><span class="title">Email Notifications.</span></h6>
<p>Email notifications are the other way you can handle notifications through GitHub. If you have this turned on you will get emails for each notification. The emails will also be threaded properly, which is nice if you’re using a threading email client.</p>
<p>There is also a fair amount of metadata embedded in the headers of the emails that GitHub sends you, which can be really helpful for setting up custom filters and rules.</p>
<p>There are a couple of interesting things here. If you want to highlight or re-route emails to this particular project or even Pull Request, the information in <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">Message-ID</code> gives you all the data in <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">&lt;user&gt;/&lt;project&gt;/&lt;type&gt;/&lt;id&gt;</code> format. If this were an issue, for example, the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">&lt;type&gt;</code> field would have been “issues” rather than “pull”.</p>
<p>The <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">List-Post</code> and <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">List-Unsubscribe</code> fields mean that if you have a mail client that understands those, you can easily post to the list or “Unsubscribe” from the thread. That would be essentially the same as clicking the “mute” button on the web version of the notification or “Unsubscribe” on the Issue or Pull Request page itself.</p>
<p>It’s also worth noting that if you have both email and web notifications enabled and you read the email version of the notification, the web version will be marked as read as well if you have images allowed in your mail client.</p></section></section></section><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_git_github.html#_the_notifications_page" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
