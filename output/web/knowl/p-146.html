<p>Even in the best of circumstances a typical pull request initiates further discussion and/or recommendation(s) for improvements from the core team of the OSS project. To those new to the OSS world, these discussions may come as a surprise, but they should not. Best practice before making a pull request is to have initiated an earlier discussion using something like the favored issue tracker or other form or asynchronous communication utilized by the project. Even then the core OSS term is likely to ask for further refinements. This is normal and to be expected.</p>
