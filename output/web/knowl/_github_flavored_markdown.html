<section class="paragraphs"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">GitHub Flavored Markdown.</span></h4>  <div class="para">Linking to other Issues is just the beginning of interesting things you can do with almost any text box on GitHub. In Issue and Pull Request descriptions, comments, code comments and more, you can use what is called “GitHub Flavored Markdown”. Markdown is like writing in plain text but which is rendered richly.</div>  <div class="para">The GitHub flavor of Markdown adds more things you can do beyond the basic Markdown syntax. These can all be really useful when creating useful Pull Request or Issue comments or descriptions.</div>  <section class="paragraphs"><h5 class="heading"><span class="title">Task Lists.</span></h5>  <div class="para">A useful GitHub specific Markdown feature, especially for use in Pull Requests, is the <a class="external" href="https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-tasklists" target="_blank">Task List</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-152-hidden.html" title="Footnote 5.6.10"><sup> 10 </sup></a>. A <dfn class="terminology">task list</dfn> is a list of checkboxes of things you want to get done. Putting them into an Issue or Pull Request normally indicates things that you want to get done before you consider the item complete.</div>  <div class="para">These are often used in Pull Requests to indicate what all you would like to get done on the branch before the Pull Request will be ready to merge. The really cool part is that you can simply click the checkboxes to update the comment — you don’t have to edit the Markdown directly to check tasks off.</div>  <div class="para">What’s more, GitHub will look for task lists in your Issues and Pull Requests and show them as metadata on the pages that list them out. For example, if you have a Pull Request with tasks and you look at the overview page of all Pull Requests, you can see how far done it is. This helps people break down Pull Requests into subtasks and helps other people track the progress of the branch.</div>  <div class="para">These are incredibly useful when you open a Pull Request early and use it to track your progress through the implementation of the feature.</div> </section> <section class="paragraphs"><h5 class="heading"><span class="title">Code Snippets.</span></h5>  <div class="para">You can also add code snippets to comments. This is especially useful if you want to present something that you <em class="emphasis">could</em> try to do before actually implementing it as a commit on your branch. This is also often used to add example code of what is not working or what this Pull Request could implement.</div>  <div class="para">To add a snippet of code you have to “fence” it in backticks.</div>  <pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">```java
for(int i=0 ; i &lt; 5 ; i++)
{
   System.out.println("i is : " + i);
}
```
</pre> <div class="para">If you add a language name like we did there with ’java’, GitHub will also try to syntax highlight the snippet. In the case of the above example, it would end up rendering like <a class="external" href="ch00/_md_code" target="_blank">Rendered fenced code example</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-153-hidden.html" title="Footnote 5.6.11"><sup> 11 </sup></a>.</div> </section> <section class="paragraphs"><h5 class="heading"><span class="title">Quoting.</span></h5>  <div class="para">If you’re responding to a small part of a long comment, you can selectively quote out of the other comment by preceding the lines with the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">&gt;</code> character. In fact, this is so common and so useful that there is a keyboard shortcut for it. If you highlight text in a comment that you want to directly reply to and hit the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">r</code> key, it will quote that text in the comment box for you.</div>  <div class="para">The quotes look something like this:</div>  <pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">&gt; Whether 'tis Nobler in the mind to suffer
&gt; The Slings and Arrows of outrageous Fortune,

How big are these slings and in particular, these arrows?
