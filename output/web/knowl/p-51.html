<p>There’s a saying about software programs: they’re never finished, only abandoned. There’s always more work to do to improve any software project. The thing that makes OSS so unique, and so interesting to the aspiring programmer, is that anyone can participate in a OSS project. Most large projects can benefit from contribution by even novice programmers. There are also more OSS projects than ever before, with an almost unlimited number of interesting problems. Want to learn how web browsers work? Hack on Firefox. Want to put together an awesome multilingual book reader for the blind? Hack on espeak.</p>
