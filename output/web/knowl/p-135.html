<p>Communication in an open-source community takes many forms, but all of these break down into two broad categories: synchronous (live/concurrent) and asynchronous (non-simultaneous). Due to the geographically-dispersed nature of most communities, most OSS communication makes heavy use of asynchronous technologies. Synchronous communications typically includes various forms of audio/video chat, which is not convenient nor efficient for widely dispersed OSS communities. Asynchronous communications are much more varied and some OSS communities use more than one asynchronous form of communication. It's no accident that open source in its current form has grown hand-in-hand with the Internet nor that the vast majority of OSS communication is asynchronous.</p>
