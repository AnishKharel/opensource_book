<p>So, what is Git in a nutshell? This is an important topic to absorb, because if you understand what Git is and the fundamentals of how it works, then using Git effectively will probably be much easier for you. As you learn Git, try to clear your mind of the things you may know about other VCSs— doing so will help you avoid subtle confusion when using the tool. Even though Git’s user interface is fairly similar to  other VCSs, Git stores and thinks about information in a very different way, and understanding these differences will help you avoid becoming confused while using it.</p>
