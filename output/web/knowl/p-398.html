<p>If you could read only one section to get going with Git, this would be the one to read. This section covers every basic command you need to do the vast majority of the things youâ€™ll eventually spend your time doing with Git. By the end of this section, you should be able to configure and initialize a repository, begin and stop tracking files, and stage and commit changes. You will also learn how to set up Git to ignore certain files and file patterns, how to undo mistakes quickly and easily, how to browse the history of your project and view changes between commits, and how to push and pull from remote repositories.</p>
