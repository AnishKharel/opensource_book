<span class="heading"><span class="title">What is a <dfn class="terminology">terminal</dfn>?</span></span><p>The English word <dfn class="terminology">terminal</dfn> means to be situated at the end of something. In computing, a terminal is situated at the user end of a computer and is a program used for entering information into and receiving information from a computer.</p>
</li>

<span class="heading"><span class="title">What is a <dfn class="terminology">console</dfn>?</span></span><p>The English word <dfn class="terminology">console</dfn> comes from the related verb, <em class="emphasis">to console</em>, which means to provide support. In computing, the original meaning of the <dfn class="terminology">console</dfn> was as a physical device that supported input into and output from a computer. The term is still used that way, but it has also come to be synonymous with terminal in some environments. For example, if you search for console on a Windows machine, you may find the terminal program and/or you may find a security console program.</p>

<span class="heading"><span class="title">What is a <dfn class="terminology">Command Line Interface (CLI)</dfn>?</span></span><p>A <dfn class="terminology">CLI</dfn> is any type of interface that is used to enter text-based commands. We will use a specialized CLI.</p>
</li>
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">What is a <dfn class="terminology">shell</dfn>?</span></span><p>A <dfn class="terminology">shell</dfn> is a specialized program which parses and interprets the commands you enter in the terminal and then asks the operating system to execute them. In other words, a shell is a highly specialized CLI which serves as the interface between the end-user and the operating system. It is called a shell because it is the user interface or the outermost layer "around" the <dfn class="terminology">kernel</dfn> which is the innermost part of the operating system.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="continuation">Although these terms are distinct from one another as described above, you will often hear people use the terms terminal, CLI, console, and shell almost interchangeably. Don't let it worry you too much because you should almost always be able to understand what is meant from the context.</p>
