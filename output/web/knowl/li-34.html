</h4>
<p>Software developers use <dfn class="terminology">pull request</dfn> to describe a request to initiate the process of requesting an integration of specific code changes into the project repository.  Like issue trackers, pull requests are not merely a notification, instead pull requests typically serves as an entirely separate thread for discussing the new code.</p>
<p>Even in the best of circumstances a typical pull request initiates further discussion and/or recommendation(s) for improvements from the core team of the OSS project. To those new to the OSS world, these discussions might come as a surprise, but they should not. Best practice is to have initiated a far earlier discussion using something like the favored issue tracker or other form or asynchronous communication utilized by the project.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_community_communication.html#li-34" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
