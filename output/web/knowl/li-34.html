</h4>
<p>Software developers use the term <dfn class="terminology">merge request</dfn> or <dfn class="terminology">pull request (PR)</dfn> to describe a request to initiate the process of requesting an integration of specific code changes into the project repository. Best practice before making a merge request is to have initiated an earlier discussion using one of the forms of communication favored by the project. After this discussion, a (potential) contributor opens a merge request, which may then undergo several iterations of automatic checks, manual code reviews by one or more other contributor, as well as further discussion.</p>
<p>It is important to understand that even in the best of circumstances, the typical merge request initiates further discussion and/or recommendation(s) for improvements from the core team of the OSS project. To those new to the OSS world, these discussions may come as a surprise, but they should not. Even then the core OSS term is likely to ask for further refinements. This is normal and to be expected.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_community_communication.html#li-34" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
