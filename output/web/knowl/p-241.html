<p>Prior to the development of the first programmable electronic computers, computers were people (mostly women) who used mechanical calculators to compute complex mathematical computations quickly and accurately. The earliest electronic computers, such as Colossus and ENIAC, required specialized technical knowledge and skill to program because programming these machines was a complex process that involved physically entering commands flipping switches, pushing buttons, and manually moving patch cords. The development of the <dfn class="terminology">terminal interface</dfn> in the 1960s marked a significant shift in the way users interacted with computers because the terminal provided a convenient and much more accessible way to provide input and obtain output, allowing users to remotely interact with a computer via a keyboard and screen.  Back when the terminal was first used in computing, what we refer to as the terminal today was the only interface available to the user, while now it is used to refer to a specific type of text-based programming interface. In particular, today a <dfn class="terminology">terminal</dfn> simply refers to a text-based interface that allows a user to interact with a computer by entering commands and receiving output on a display screen.</p>
