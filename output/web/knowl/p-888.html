<div class="para">An <dfn class="terminology">issue</dfn> typically refers to any problem, request, or task that is tracked and managed within the projectâ€™s issue tracking system. While issues can include bugs and defects, they are not limited to technical problems alone. Issues can encompass a wide range of things, including feature requests, bug reports, documentation improvements, or even general discussions about the project. They serve as a centralized way for contributors and maintainers to communicate and collaborate on various aspects of the project.</div>
