<p>Find five bug reports in the <em class="emphasis">new</em> state, and attempt to triage them according to the rules above. Your goal is to do as much as you possibly can, in a short period of time, to make those bug reports as useful as possible to the developer to whom they are assigned. (Note: be sure to follow any triage rules that your project may have defined. If there are no set triage rules, be sure to announce your intentions on the project’s mailing list, so that developers can provide you some guidelines if they choose.)</p>
