<p>Given that the Graphical User Interface (GUI) came into widespread use decades ago, it may seem surprising that nearly all software developers utilize a non-graphical shell. The primary reasons for this include:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">Speed uf Use.</span></span><p>The shell facilitates all commands at the speed one can type them, which is typically many times faster than commands can typically be selected from a menu.</p>
</li>
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">Expressiveness.</span></span><p>The shell facilitates features that are unavailable or difficult to access in a GUI. The mouse only allows for picking among the small set of predetermined options from the screen. However, for most systems many more options are actually available. In addition, most operating systems  prevent you from performing certain tasks which are system protected unless you are using the shell.</p>
</li>
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">Automation.</span></span><p>If you need to do something that is repetitive or requires combining multiple commands, the shell facilitates this too. For example, it would be hard to a GUI to find all files that contain a particular pattern and then perform some operation on all of them, but this is easy with a shell program.</p>
