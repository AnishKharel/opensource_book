<div class="para">There’s  a lot more to good software than just the code. How do you make sure people have the resources and knowledge they need to find and run (and/or contribute to) the software that you make? Beautiful code that doesn’t get used is exactly as useful as code that was never written. Even the very best code can still have bugs, which means the ability to find and eliminate bugs is a critical skill for all software engineers. If you don’t know how to find the bugs your users find, you’re in trouble. Which is why we cover documentation  and the mechanics of fixing code in the chapter entitled <a href="ch_documentation.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 6: Documentation">Chapter 6</a>.</div>
