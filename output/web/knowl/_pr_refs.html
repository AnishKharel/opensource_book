<p>If you’re dealing with a <dfn class="terminology">lot</dfn> of Pull Requests and don’t want to add a bunch of remotes or do one time pulls every time, there is a neat trick that GitHub allows you to do. This is a bit of an advanced trick and we’ll go over the details of this a bit more in <a class="external" href="ch00/_refspec" target="_blank">The Refspec</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-122-hidden.html" title="Footnote 6.4.37"><sup> 37 </sup></a>, but it can be pretty useful.</p>
<p>GitHub actually advertises the Pull Request branches for a repository as sort of pseudo-branches on the server. By default you don’t get them when you clone, but they are there in an obscured way and you can access them pretty easily.</p>
<p>To demonstrate this, we’re going to use a low-level command (often referred to as a “plumbing” command, which we’ll read about more in <a class="external" href="ch00/_plumbing_porcelain" target="_blank">Plumbing and Porcelain</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-123-hidden.html" title="Footnote 6.4.38"><sup> 38 </sup></a>) called <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">ls-remote</code>. This command is generally not used in day-to-day Git operations but it’s useful to show us what references are present on the server.</p>
<p>If we run this command against the “blink” repository we were using earlier, we will get a list of all the branches and tags and other references in the repository.</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">$ git ls-remote https://github.com/schacon/blink
10d539600d86723087810ec636870a504f4fee4d    HEAD
10d539600d86723087810ec636870a504f4fee4d    refs/heads/master
6a83107c62950be9453aac297bb0193fd743cd6e    refs/pull/1/head
afe83c2d1a70674c9505cc1d8b7d380d5e076ed3    refs/pull/1/merge
3c8d735ee16296c242be7a9742ebfbc2665adec1    refs/pull/2/head
15c9f4f80973a2758462ab2066b6ad9fe8dcf03d    refs/pull/2/merge
a5a7751a33b7e86c5e9bb07b26001bb17d775d1a    refs/pull/4/head
31a45fc257e8433c8d8804e3e848cf61c9d3166c    refs/pull/4/merge
</pre>
<p>Of course, if you’re in your repository and you run <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git ls-remote origin</code> or whatever remote you want to check, it will show you something similar to this.</p>
<p>If the repository is on GitHub and you have any Pull Requests that have been opened, you’ll get these references that are prefixed with <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">refs/pull/</code>. These are basically branches, but since they’re not under <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">refs/heads/</code> you don’t get them normally when you clone or fetch from the server — the process of fetching ignores them normally.</p>
<p>There are two references per Pull Request - the one that ends in <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">/head</code> points to exactly the same commit as the last commit in the Pull Request branch. So if someone opens a Pull Request in our repository and their branch is named <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">bug-fix</code> and it points to commit <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">a5a775</code>, then in <dfn class="terminology">our</dfn> repository we will not have a <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">bug-fix</code> branch (since that’s in their fork), but we <em class="emphasis">will</em> have <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">pull/&lt;pr#&gt;/head</code> that points to <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">a5a775</code>. This means that we can pretty easily pull down every Pull Request branch in one go without having to add a bunch of remotes.</p>
<p>Now, you could do something like fetching the reference directly.</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">$ git fetch origin refs/pull/958/head
From https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2
 * branch            refs/pull/958/head -&gt; FETCH_HEAD
</pre>
<p>This tells Git, “Connect to the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">origin</code> remote, and download the ref named <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">refs/pull/958/head</code>.” Git happily obeys, and downloads everything you need to construct that ref, and puts a pointer to the commit you want under <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">.git/FETCH_HEAD</code>. You can follow that up with <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git merge FETCH_HEAD</code> into a branch you want to test it in, but that merge commit message looks a bit weird. Also, if you’re reviewing a <dfn class="terminology">lot</dfn> of pull requests, this gets tedious.</p>
<p>There’s also a way to fetch <em class="emphasis">all</em> of the pull requests, and keep them up to date whenever you connect to the remote. Open up <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">.git/config</code> in your favorite editor, and look for the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">origin</code> remote. It should look a bit like this:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">[remote "origin"]
    url = https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2
    fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
</pre>
<p>That line that begins with <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">fetch =</code> is a “refspec.” It’s a way of mapping names on the remote with names in your local <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">.git</code> directory. This particular one tells Git, "the things on the remote that are under <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">refs/heads</code> should go in my local repository under <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">refs/remotes/origin</code>." You can modify this section to add another refspec:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">[remote "origin"]
    url = https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2.git
    fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
    fetch = +refs/pull/*/head:refs/remotes/origin/pr/*
</pre>
<p>That last line tells Git, “All the refs that look like <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">refs/pull/123/head</code> should be stored locally like <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">refs/remotes/origin/pr/123</code>.” Now, if you save that file, and do a <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git fetch</code>:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">$ git fetch
# …
 * [new ref]         refs/pull/1/head -&gt; origin/pr/1
 * [new ref]         refs/pull/2/head -&gt; origin/pr/2
 * [new ref]         refs/pull/4/head -&gt; origin/pr/4
# …
</pre>
<p>Now all of the remote pull requests are represented locally with refs that act much like tracking branches; they’re read-only, and they update when you do a fetch. This makes it super easy to try the code from a pull request locally:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">$ git checkout pr/2
Checking out files: 100% (3769/3769), done.
Branch pr/2 set up to track remote branch pr/2 from origin.
Switched to a new branch 'pr/2'
</pre>
<p>The eagle-eyed among you would note the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">head</code> on the end of the remote portion of the refspec. There’s also a <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">refs/pull/#/merge</code> ref on the GitHub side, which represents the commit that would result if you push the “merge” button on the site. This can allow you to test the merge before even hitting the button.</p></section><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_git_github.html#_pr_refs" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
