<p>Inside of a directory, we can find files and possibly additional directories. As we just discussed, depending upon your system, a directory may actually just be a file that contains a list of other files, so you will see the both files and directories presented similarly by the shell. Using a different metaphor, you can think of all of the directories in your entire system as forming a tree structure which grows downward from a single directory which is known as the <dfn class="terminology">root directory</dfn>. In other words, the top level directory which is the parent of all directories is called the 'root' directory. It is referenced by the use of forward slash symbol (<dfn class="terminology">/</dfn>) when the forward slash symbol is used alone (or at least with nothing prepended in front of it). </p>
