<section class="paragraphs"><h5 class="heading"><span class="title">Pull Requests as Patches.</span></h5>
<p>It’s important to understand that many projects don’t really think of Pull Requests as queues of perfect patches that should apply cleanly in order, as most mailing list-based projects think of patch series contributions. Most GitHub projects think about Pull Request branches as iterative conversations around a proposed change, culminating in a unified diff that is applied by merging.</p>
<p>This is an important distinction, because generally the change is suggested before the code is thought to be perfect, which is far more rare with mailing list based patch series contributions. This enables an earlier conversation with the maintainers so that arriving at the proper solution is more of a community effort. When code is proposed with a Pull Request and the maintainers or community suggest a change, the patch series is generally not re-rolled, but instead the difference is pushed as a new commit to the branch, moving the conversation forward with the context of the previous work intact.</p>
<p>For instance, if you go back and look again at <a class="external" href="ch00/_pr_final" target="_blank">Pull Request final</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-147-hidden.html" title="Footnote 5.4.15"><sup> 15 </sup></a>, you’ll notice that the contributor did not rebase his commit and send another Pull Request. Instead they added new commits and pushed them to the existing branch. This way if you go back and look at this Pull Request in the future, you can easily find all of the context of why decisions were made. Pushing the “Merge” button on the site purposefully creates a merge commit that references the Pull Request so that it’s easy to go back and research the original conversation if necessary.</p></section><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_git_github.html#_pull_requests_as_patches" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
