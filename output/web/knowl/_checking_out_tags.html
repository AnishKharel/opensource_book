<p>If you want to view the versions of files a tag is pointing to, you can do a <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git checkout</code> of that tag, although this puts your repository in “detached HEAD” state, which has some ill side effects:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">$ git checkout v2.0.0
Note: switching to 'v2.0.0'.

You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.

If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
do so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:

  git switch -c &lt;new-branch-name&gt;

Or undo this operation with:

  git switch -

Turn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false

HEAD is now at 99ada87... Merge pull request #89 from schacon/appendix-final

$ git checkout v2.0-beta-0.1
Previous HEAD position was 99ada87... Merge pull request #89 from schacon/appendix-final
HEAD is now at df3f601... Add atlas.json and cover image
</pre>
<p>In “detached HEAD” state, if you make changes and then create a commit, the tag will stay the same, but your new commit won’t belong to any branch and will be unreachable, except by the exact commit hash. Thus, if you need to make changes — say you’re fixing a bug on an older version, for instance — you will generally want to create a branch:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">$ git checkout -b version2 v2.0.0
Switched to a new branch 'version2'
</pre>
<p>If you do this and make a commit, your <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">version2</code> branch will be slightly different than your <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">v2.0.0</code> tag since it will move forward with your new changes, so do be careful.</p></section><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_git_basics.html#_checking_out_tags" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
