<p>Let’s change a file that was already tracked. If you change a previously tracked file called <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">CONTRIBUTING.md</code> and then run your <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git status</code> command again, you get something that looks like this:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)

    new file:   README

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;..." to discard changes in working directory)

    modified:   CONTRIBUTING.md
</pre>
<p>The <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">CONTRIBUTING.md</code> file appears under a section named “Changes not staged for commit” — which means that a file that is tracked has been modified in the working directory but not yet staged. To stage it, you run the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git add</code> command. <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git add</code> is a multipurpose command — you use it to begin tracking new files, to stage files, and to do other things like marking merge-conflicted files as resolved. It may be helpful to think of it more as “add precisely this content to the next commit” rather than “add this file to the project”. Let’s run <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git add</code> now to stage the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">CONTRIBUTING.md</code> file, and then run <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git status</code> again:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">$ git add CONTRIBUTING.md
$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)

    new file:   README
    modified:   CONTRIBUTING.md
</pre>
<p>Both files are staged and will go into your next commit. At this point, suppose you remember one little change that you want to make in <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">CONTRIBUTING.md</code> before you commit it. You open it again and make that change, and you’re ready to commit. However, let’s run <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git status</code> one more time:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">$ vim CONTRIBUTING.md
$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)

    new file:   README
    modified:   CONTRIBUTING.md

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;..." to discard changes in working directory)

    modified:   CONTRIBUTING.md
</pre>
<p>What the heck? Now <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">CONTRIBUTING.md</code> is listed as both staged <em class="emphasis">and</em> unstaged. How is that possible? It turns out that Git stages a file exactly as it is when you run the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git add</code> command. If you commit now, the version of <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">CONTRIBUTING.md</code> as it was when you last ran the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git add</code> command is how it will go into the commit, not the version of the file as it looks in your working directory when you run <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git commit</code>. If you modify a file after you run <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git add</code>, you have to run <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git add</code> again to stage the latest version of the file:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">$ git add CONTRIBUTING.md
$ git status
