<p>Each FOSS project builds its own unique community with its own qualities. Some communities are small, others large; some are highly structured, some are much more casual; some readily welcome new contributors, others have high barriers to entry; and some communities are global, while others are very local. One of the first steps in getting involved with an open source community is to scout out the lay of the land and discover the characteristics of the community. To do so, you need to understand the qualities you're looking for, and you need to understand how to communicate with the community.</p>
