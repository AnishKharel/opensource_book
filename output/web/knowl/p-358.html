<p>Once you have made all of your shopping choices and are ready to commit to paying for the items in your shopping cart, you go through the process of paying. This is analogous to <em class="emphasis">committing</em> â€” you have made a commitment to receive the items that you paid for, and the online store keeps a record of your purchase. Of course, once you receive the shirt and it isn't quite what you had hoped for, you can still return the shirt, but it is more complicated to do so than before you made the purchase and a record will be made of the return as well. This is also analogous to how Git works.</p>
