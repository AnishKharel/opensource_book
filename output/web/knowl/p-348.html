<p><dfn class="terminology">Virtualization</dfn> is a technique that allows for one or more virtual (or simulated) environments to run in a given physical hardware system. Virtualization refers to the creation of virtual versions of physical resources, such as operating systems, servers, and storage.  Virtualization allows multiple applications and/or operating systems to run on the same physical machine, sharing the actual hardware resources while operating as if they have dedicated resources, but each virtualized system runs within its allocated resources, such as memory, processing power, and storage. This can provide cost-savings, flexibility, and increased efficiency.</p>
