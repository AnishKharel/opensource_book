<div class="para">It goes without saying that an OSS needs to store the code base in a way that it can be accessed by the community of current and potential contributors. A <dfn class="terminology">repository</dfn>, aka <dfn class="terminology">repo</dfn>, is a file storage location used by a version control system to keep track of not only versions of the code base itself but also to keep track of project documentation, discussions, web pages, and more. Repos are nearly always hosted in a SECP, although they are also sometimes self-hosted by the project.</div>
