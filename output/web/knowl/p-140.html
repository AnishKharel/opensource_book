<div class="para">The first place where people discover an OSS community is typically a website.  To make a website available to all users, it must be hosted on a web server referred to as a <dfn class="terminology">host</dfn> that serves the page. Unfortunately, the nature of traditional HTML pages is that they are often a static, one-to-many form of communication created by a small number of people with write access to the server. This leads to websites that can become quickly outdated and which do not truly reflect the collaborative nature of the community. We will see how OSS communities work around this issue and make their website a collaborative project in the next section.</div>
