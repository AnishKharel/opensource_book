<p>In addition to web hosting, several other forms of asynchronous communication tools are provided as part of the typical OSS software engineering collaboration platform. These tools arise naturally from the need to discuss issues surrounding code and code improvements. While these often include the following, not all of these are utilized by every project and even when they are utilized, they sometimes exist apart from the SECP:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">Code Repositories.</span></span><p>As mentioned above, it goes without saying that an OSS needs a code base which can be stored in one or more code <dfn class="terminology">repository</dfn>, aka <dfn class="terminology">repo</dfn>. Repos are typically hosted in a SECP, although they after also sometimes self-hosted by the project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">Bug and Issue Trackers.</span></span><p>Issue trackers were originally designed to record, track, and resolve user-encountered issues including bugs. However, issue trackers are also often used by users to submit feature-requests.</p>
<p>When an issue is posted, short discussions on the issue often occur. These discussions are most conveniently attached to the issue itself to facilitate the tracking of the discussion, which is particularly important in larger projects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">Discussion and Project Queues.</span></span><p>Many OSS projects span multiple code repositories. Discussion and project queues afford discussions of wider scope that are not limited to a single issue or feature request and/or aren't specific to a single code repository.</p>
</li>
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">Request for code integration (aka pull request).</span></span><p>Software developers use the term <dfn class="terminology">pull request (PR)</dfn> to describe a request to initiate the process of requesting an integration of specific code changes into the project repository.  Like issue trackers, pull requests are not merely a notification, they are a request.</p>
<p>Even in the best of circumstances a typical pull request initiates further discussion and/or recommendation(s) for improvements from the core team of the OSS project. To those new to the OSS world, these discussions may come as a surprise, but they should not. Best practice before making a pull request is to have initiated an earlier discussion using something like the favored issue tracker or other form or asynchronous communication utilized by the project. Even then the core OSS term is likely to ask for further refinements. This is normal and to be expected.</p>
