<p>When you make actions correctly in Git, nearly all of them only <em class="emphasis">add</em> data to the Git database. It is intended to be hard to get Git to do anything that is not undoable or to make it erase data in any way. As with any VCS, you can lose or mess up changes you havenâ€™t committed yet, but after you commit a snapshot into Git, it is more difficult to lose, especially if you regularly push your database to another repository. Having said this, novices can get themselves into a mess. Some advice is to always make sure you are working on a branch <em class="emphasis">other than main or master</em>, and always check to be sure you are on the intended branch before you begin working.</p>
<p>For a more in-depth look at how Git stores its data and how you can recover data that seems lost, see Undoing Things.</p></section><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_git_getting_started.html#sec_git_generally_only_adds_data" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
