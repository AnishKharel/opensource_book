<p>One question you might have is whether you can use your existing machine to contribute to open source. The good news is that whether you are using macOS, Linux, or Windows you should be able to set up a development environment, open a terminal, and access an appropriate shell.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">On a Mac.</span></span><p>If you are on a Mac, you have a couple of good options.  With any Mac, the built-in <em class="emphasis">Terminal</em> program, will allow you to access a shell, and on newer Macs, you  might want to consider <a class="external" href="https://iterm2.com/downloads.html" target="_blank">iTerm2</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-108-hidden.html" title="Footnote 4.1.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a>, a much improved replacement for Terminal that works on Macs with macOS 10.14 or newer. Opening the Terminal on a Mac works like opening any other program: you can find it in the Applications folder, you can search for it, you can use the Launchpad, or you can use it's shortcut which is command(⌘)+T.</p>
</li>
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">In Linux.</span></span><p>In Linux, the terminal is also called the <em class="emphasis">Terminal</em>. You can access it in several ways: search for the keyword Terminal, right-click  on your desktop and then select "Open Terminal", or use the shortcut Ctrl+Alt+T.</p>
</li>
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">In Windows.</span></span><p>If you are on a Windows machine, getting to an appropriate shell is a bit more complicated. On Windows, the terminal/shell is historically called the <dfn class="terminology">command prompt (cmd)</dfn>, although a newer very different terminal/shell called <dfn class="terminology">PowerShell</dfn> was first widely released in 2016. Neither of these terminal/shells are compatible with the default shell programs available on macOS and Linux. For OSS development, it will be preferable to have access to such a shell. If you are running Windows 11 or Windows 10 version 2004 or higher, then following the directions from Microsoft on <a class="external" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install" target="_blank">Installing Linux on Windows with WSL2</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-109-hidden.html" title="Footnote 4.1.2"><sup> 2 </sup></a> will give you the best experience. Note that you may first need to update your Windows OS, see <a class="external" href="https://bit.ly/Windows-Update-FAQ" target="_blank"><code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">https://bit.ly/Windows-Update-FAQ</code></a>. WSL2 provides a full Linux kernel that is integrated into the Windows operating system. Installing <a class="external" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/install" target="_blank">the Windows Terminal</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-110-hidden.html" title="Footnote 4.1.3"><sup> 3 </sup></a> will further enhance your experience, although it is not strictly necessary. Once you have followed the linked directions to install WSL2, including the installation of Linux (Ubuntu is a good choice),  then the shell is most easily accessed by searching for Ubuntu in the search tool next to the Windows Icon and selecting it when you see it. For convenience, consider right-clicking on the Ubuntu icon and pinning it to your Start menu or to your Taskbar.</p>
<p>If you are running an earlier version of Windows and cannot upgrade to Windows 10 version 2004 or higher, then you have several choices. For simpler development environments, using <a class="external" href="https://mingw.osdn.io/index.html" target="_blank">MinGW</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-111-hidden.html" title="Footnote 4.1.4"><sup> 4 </sup></a> provides a lightweight solution, so you might try this first. For a more complicated development environment such as one that utilizes virtualization, using a Virtual Machine (VM) environment such as <a class="external" href="https://www.virtualbox.org/" target="_blank">Virtual Box</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-112-hidden.html" title="Footnote 4.1.5"><sup> 5 </sup></a> and installing and running Ubuntu inside the VM is advisable. For a cloud option, see below.</p>
</li>

<span class="heading"><span class="title">Another OS.</span></span><p>Although Linux, Mac, and Windows (to a lesser extent) are by far the most typical development environments, developing in another OS environment might also be possible. For example, searching the Internet on "software development in ChromeOS" will provide several useful links for how to set up a development environment in ChromeOS. Just be aware that developing in an OS environment other than Linux, Mac, or a modern version of Windows is likely to offer little in the way of support, so you might be better off using a Virtual Machine (VM) environment such as <a class="external" href="https://www.virtualbox.org/" target="_blank">Virtual Box</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-113-hidden.html" title="Footnote 4.1.6"><sup> 6 </sup></a> and installing and running Ubuntu in the VM. Of course, another option is to turn to cloud development, which is discussed next.</p>
</li>
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">In the Cloud.</span></span><p>To contribute to most open source projects, you will need to set-up a build environment for local testing. White it is typical to install this on a local machine, it can be done in the cloud typically for free for low usage or for a small monthly fee, which might be waived for a trial period or for students.</p>
<p><dfn class="terminology">Cloud Development Environments (CDEs)</dfn> are full development environments in the cloud. A few of the more popular such environments include <a class="external" href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/" target="_blank">AWS Cloud9</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-114-hidden.html" title="Footnote 4.1.7"><sup> 7 </sup></a>, <a class="external" href="https://github.com/features/codespaces" target="_blank">Github Codespaces</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-115-hidden.html" title="Footnote 4.1.8"><sup> 8 </sup></a> and <a class="external" href="https://www.gitpod.io/" target="_blank">Gitpod</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-116-hidden.html" title="Footnote 4.1.9"><sup> 9 </sup></a>. These environments try to help you set up your development environment with ease, and you can mostly likely find a way to at least try them for free.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this chapter, if you cannot quickly set up your local environment or cloud environment, you can practice using a shell at Fabrice Bellard's <a class="external" href="https://bellard.org/jslinux/" target="_blank">JSLinux</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-117-hidden.html" title="Footnote 4.1.10"><sup> 10 </sup></a> which provides a very small cloud-based virtual machine environment. (Choosing the riscv64 Linux console will work for all of these exercises.) Note that this a free service which has a capped bandwidth of 40 kB/s. You are asked to please be respectful and don't abuse the service.</p>
