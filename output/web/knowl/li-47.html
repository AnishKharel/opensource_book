<p>IRC stands for Internet Relay Chat. IRC is one of the older means of synchronous communication between people working on a OSS project, and although in the past it was one of the primary OSS communication tools, many projects have abandoned IRC for collaborative instant messaging platforms and other newer communication tools. It's a text-based federated chat system where clients connect to the servers of one or more networks, and the servers relay messages between themselves within each network (hence the name). Communication is done in channels which individual users join, and users are identified by nicks (nicknames). In addition to human users, like collaborative instant messaging platforms, various services and bots are present in many channels. However, it is very lightweight because the focus is solely on the textual content, which means it can work right from your command line. However, there is no formatting, not even new lines, no emojis, no voice or video chat, and unlike most more modern chat technologies where recordings can be automated, messages aren't easily stored, so it is designed to work only for synchronous communication.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_community_communication.html#li-47" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
