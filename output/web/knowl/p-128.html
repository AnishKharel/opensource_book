<div class="para">This is not unique – collaborative groups have always developed their own sense of identity. The difference with most OSS communities is that the collaboration is remote, so the participants remain in their native cultural context while participating in the synthetic third culture of the OSS community, and the interaction is high-volume and sustained over a long period of time (decades, in some cases). Obviously, the diversity, intensity, and health of the community play a significant role in the depth and uniqueness of the third culture.</div>
