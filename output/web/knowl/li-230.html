</h4>Â A large percentage of bugs filed against open source projects are duplicates; users frequently report bugs without searching to see if similar bugs have already been filed. Finding duplicates becomes easier with a bit of practice; the more familiar you are with a program, and the more you communicate with its developers, and the more bugs you see coming through the bug tracker, the more likely it is that you know when a bug is a duplicate. Still, even an inexperienced triager can spot obvious duplicates.</article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_bug_triage.html#li-230" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
