<p></p>
<p>Pay attention now — here is the main set of concepts to remember about files in Git if you want the rest of your learning process to go smoothly. Git has three main states that your files can reside in, <em class="emphasis">modified</em>, <em class="emphasis">staged</em>, and <em class="emphasis">committed</em>:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p><dfn class="terminology">Modified</dfn> means that you have changed the file but have not committed it to your repository yet.</p></li>
<li><p><dfn class="terminology">Staged</dfn> means that you have marked a modified file in its current version to go into your next commit snapshot.</p></li>
<li><p><dfn class="terminology">Committed</dfn> means that the data is safely stored in your local repository.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="continuation">As a metaphor for better understanding these concepts, let's imagine you are shopping for a shirt and some other items online. You find a page with a shirt you are considering, and you make several choices by clicking on things like the style (long-sleeved vs short-sleeved, for example), the size, the color, etc. The state of your browser has been modified from the default state, but you haven't completely decided if you want it, so you have not put it into your shopping cart. That is analogous to <em class="emphasis">modifying</em> your codebase before staging in Git.</p>
<p>Next, maybe you decide that you like these shirt choices enough that you don't want to lose them, so you put the style, size, and color shirt you like into your shopping cart. That is analogous to <em class="emphasis">staging</em> — you have not yet completely committed to buying the shirt, but you are ready to do so, and you are still able to change your mind and make additional changes to your choices or remove the shirt from the shopping cart altogether. You can also keep shopping and postpone making a decision about buying while you continue shopping.</p>
<p>Once you have made all of your shopping choices and are ready to commit to paying for the items in your shopping cart, you go through the process of paying. This is analogous to <em class="emphasis">committing</em> — you have made a commitment to receive the items that you paid for, and the online store keeps a record of your purchase. Of course, once you receive the shirt and it isn't quite what you had hoped for, you can still return the shirt, but it is more complicated to do so than before you made the purchase and a record will be made of the return as well. This is also analogous to how Git works.</p>
<p>The concepts of modified, staged, and committed describe the different stages that files can go through as they are modified and committed to the repository. Next, let's discuss how Git is organized.</p></section><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_git_getting_started.html#sec_the_three_states" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
