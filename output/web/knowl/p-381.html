<p>A <dfn class="terminology">virtual machine (VM)</dfn> is a simulation of a physical computer that runs its own operating system and applications as if it were a completely separate physical computer. VMs rely on a <dfn class="terminology">hypervisor</dfn> (aka a <dfn class="terminology">virtualizer</dfn>) which is a type of computer software, firmware or hardware that creates and runs virtual machines. When using a VM, the physical computer is called the <dfn class="terminology">host machine</dfn> and the virtual machine is called the <dfn class="terminology">guest machine</dfn>. Virtual machines are managed by a software component called a <dfn class="terminology">hypervisor</dfn> which makes sure that each virtual machine gets the needed resources without interfering with any real or other virtual systems.</p>
