<p>Second, call for help when you’re stuck. If you have trouble with an exercise — and at some point you will — look to your fellow contributors for help. Your chosen project has mechanisms for getting in touch with the more advanced developers: mailing lists, or IRC channels, or forums, or all of the above. Communicating with those around you is not only “not cheating,” it’s key to establishing greater understanding. Keep this in mind, though: in the real world, people are most likely to help those who are trying to help themselves. Before you ask someone a question on IRC, ask the same question of Google. A good rule of thumb: if you can’t figure something out in 15 minutes of searching the Internet, it’s reasonable to ask for a bit of help.</p>
