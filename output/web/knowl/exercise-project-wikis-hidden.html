<body class="ignore-math"><article class="exercise exercise-like"><p>Wikis are meant to be community spaces where everyone can join in. They grown and are made better through community participation. For this exercise, we’re going to encourage you to check out the wikis of three established open source projects.</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>Link to the main wiki.</p></li>
<li><p>Search in the wiki for the history and current structure of the project. Is it in the wiki, or is it somewhere else in their project?</p></li>
<li><p>When the last change was made, who made it, and how often are changes submitted. Would you describe this wiki as “thriving” or “languishing”?</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="continuation">Authoring and maintaining pages in a wiki (the latter sometimes being referred to as gardening) is a critical part of some wiki-driven OSS projects. If you’re particularly interested in a project, register an account and start contributing.</p></article></body>
