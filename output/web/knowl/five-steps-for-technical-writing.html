<p>Technical writing is more of a scientific process than an artistic one, which is good news. You can learn how to do it with a little practice, and there are methods you can follow. The method in this book is one that is common to good software projects, whether open source or not. It is a waterfall method and applies from large to small efforts, sets of books down to a five paragraph section on a wiki.:</p>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><p>Planning – Who is the audience? What are the goals?</p></li>
<li><p>Content – What is the work about? Where will you get the information?</p></li>
<li><p>Writing – First draft, review, second draft ...</p></li>
<li><p>Internationalisation/Internationalization – What spelling conventions will be used? Will the work be translated? If so, into what languages?</p></li>
<li><p>Review – What worked? What didn’t? How will the work be maintained?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>It’s called a waterfall model because if you start at the top, the results of the first step are used to move into the second step, just like water flowing down a series of steps into a pool.</p>
<p>Anyone with a scientific or engineering mind can create technical documentation, they might not enjoy it, but they are more than capable of creating it.</p></section><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_documentation_matters.html#five-steps-for-technical-writing" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
