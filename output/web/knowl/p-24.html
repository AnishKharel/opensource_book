<p>And third, be bold. Try things. Break stuff. Don’t be afraid to play around with the code; it’s only code, after all, and if you break something, you can always revert to the previous version. If you reach a point at which you think you’re ready to make a contribution of some kind, then offer to help on the project mailing list. The answer will usually be “go ahead, thanks!” Sometimes the offer will be “no thanks, and here’s why,” and you’ll learn something. Occasionally the answer will be “no, go away,” which is also useful, since it tells you to invest your energies into another project. Sometimes the answer may be silence; don’t be afraid to keep asking until you get an answer, or even plunge ahead without one. Learn the rules of the project and follow them; if the rules of the project are vague or confusing, you can help to make them clear. This alone can be a critical contribution, as it clearly helps those who come along after you.</p>
