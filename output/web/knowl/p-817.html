It is intended to ensure that the project is welcoming and respectful to all. If you are interested in getting involved in an OSS project, be sure to read this file not only so you know how you should behave, but also so you know how you can expect to be treated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">CONTRIBUTING.</span></span><p>The CONTRIBUTING file is important to look for if interested in getting involved in a new project because it provides guidelines for contributors, including how to submit code changes, how to report bugs, and how to get help.</p>
