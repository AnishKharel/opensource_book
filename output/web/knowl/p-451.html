<div class="para">As a metaphor for better understanding these concepts, let’s imagine you are shopping for a shirt and some other items online. You find a page with a shirt you are considering, and you make several choices by clicking on things like the style (long-sleeved vs short-sleeved, for example), the size, the color, etc. The state of your browser has been modified from the default state, but you haven’t completely decided if you want it, so you have not put it into your shopping cart. That is analogous to <em class="emphasis">modifying</em> your codebase before staging in Git.</div>
