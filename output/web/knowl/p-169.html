<div class="para">Web-based forums have some similarities to email lists because users can subscribe to receive updates via email. However, conversations in forums are typically grouped by discussion topic and are often better-organized than email archives, which makes them easier to browse and search. People on a  forum typically have handles or nicknames, rarely using their full real name, unlike in email. Many OSS communities have one or more forums specific to various aspects of the project. There are also forums that span multiple OSS communities. For example, <a class="external" href="https://itsfoss.community/" target="_blank">It’s FOSS Community</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-59-hidden.html" title="Footnote 2.4.26"><sup> 26 </sup></a> is an example of an active forum on FOSS.</div>
