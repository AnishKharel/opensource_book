Also, I'm getting screen lockups in Barchat. I think they're related.

<p>It’s tempting sometimes to see multiple issues, convince yourself that they are related, and then file a single bug on the whole thing.</p>
<p>Don’t do that. You may very well be right that the issues are related — but you may also be wrong, and in either case, two different issues deserve two different bug reports. In our example above, it may be that the issues with <dfn class="terminology">Foomail</dfn> and <dfn class="terminology">Barchat</dfn> are actually related to a problem with <dfn class="terminology">Bazlib</dfn>, which is a shared component of <dfn class="terminology">Foomail</dfn> and <dfn class="terminology">Barchat</dfn>. Each bug must be fixed and tested in its own context, and that won’t work if they’re all stuffed in the same bug report.</p></section><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_bug_reports.html#paragraphs-25" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
