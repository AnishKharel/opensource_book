<p></p>
<p>Shell commands are simply commands that are typed into the shell. As our very first shell command to try, let's try the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">echo</code> command which simply echos or displays the argument to the screen.  Try the following (exactly as written):</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">echo "I love open source!"
</pre>
<p>You should have seen the text "I love open source!" printed on the screen. Now if that were all the echo command could do, it would be a fairly pointless command. The <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">echo</code> command's real power is in displaying the contents of variables and files as we will soon see.</p>
<p>The shell is designed to work in a multi-user environment, so there are users. If you type the following shell command:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">whoami
</pre>
<p>The shell should respond with the username that you created when you set up your system.  For me that is <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">pearcej</code>.</p>
<p>Note that the shell is <dfn class="terminology">case sensitive</dfn>, which means that it discriminates between uppercase and lowercase letters, so two words that in letter cases only, are not considered equal. This means that <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">Echo</code>, <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">ECHO</code>, <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">WhoAmI</code>, and <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">WHOAMI</code>  are not shell commands, so if you accidentally type one of these, you will likely elicit a response like:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">Command 'WhoAmI' not found
</pre>
<p>or if you are lucky, you might get something more helpful like:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">Command 'Echo' not found, did you mean:
    command 'echo'
</pre>
<p>You might wonder how the operating system keeps track of its users. For each user, there is a user environment variable called USER that is specific only to the currently logged-in user. It can be accessed using the echo command that we already saw.  Try the following:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">echo $USER
</pre>
<p>You should see the same result as you saw with the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">whoami</code> command! Note that you must precede the variable name with a dollar sign $ whenever you reference the value it contains. Isn't it interesting to peek inside the variable in that way?</p></section><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_dev_basic_shell_commands.html#paragraphs-6" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
