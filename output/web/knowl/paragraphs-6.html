<section class="paragraphs"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Introduction to Shell Commands.</span></h4>
<p></p>
<p>Shell commands are simply commands that are typed into the shell. As our very first shell command to try, let's try the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">echo</code> command which simply echos or displays the argument to the terminal.  Try the following (exactly as written):</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">echo "I love open source!"
</pre>
<p>You should have seen the text "I love open source!" printed in the terminal. Now if that were all the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">echo</code> command could do, it would be a fairly pointless command. The <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">echo</code> command's real power is in displaying the contents of variables and files as we will soon see.</p>
<p>The shell is designed to work in a multi-user environment, so it is designed to support users. If you type the following shell command:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">whoami
</pre>
<p>The shell should respond with the username that you created when you set up your system.  For me that is <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">pearcej</code>.</p>
<p>Note that your environment might be <dfn class="terminology">case sensitive</dfn>, which means that it might discriminate between uppercase and lowercase letters, where two words that in letter cases only, are not considered equal. This means that <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">Echo</code>, <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">ECHO</code>, <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">WhoAmI</code>, and <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">WHOAMI</code>  might not be recognized as  shell commands, so you are in a case sensitive environment and accidentally type one of these, you will elicit a response like:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">Command 'WhoAmI' not found
</pre>
<p>or if you are in a case sensitive environment and you are lucky, you might get something more helpful like:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">Command 'Echo' not found, did you mean:
    command 'echo'
</pre>
<p>You might wonder how the operating system keeps track of its users. For each user, there is a user environment variable called USER that is specific only to the currently logged-in user. An <dfn class="terminology">environment variable</dfn> is a value that contains information about the system environment or the currently logged-in user. Having environment variables is a way of keeping track of information about the system environment and serves as a way to pass information about the environment to programs. The USER environment variable can be accessed using the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">echo</code> command that we already saw.  Try the following:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">echo $USER
</pre>
<p>You should see the same result as you saw with the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">whoami</code> command! Note that you must precede the variable name with a dollar sign $ whenever you reference the value it contains. Isn't it interesting to peek inside the environment variable in that way?</p>
<p>In fact, one of the key uses of the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">echo</code> command is to echo the values of a variety of variables. Let's see another example:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">echo $SHELL
</pre>
<p>You will likely see something like the following printed:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">/bin/bash
</pre>
<p>The reason you see something like this is because the SHELL environment variable stores the location of the shell program. This location, called the <dfn class="terminology">file path</dfn>, is given in the form of the path needed to find the location. We explore how this path is described in the next section.</p></section><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_dev_basic_shell_commands.html#paragraphs-6" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
