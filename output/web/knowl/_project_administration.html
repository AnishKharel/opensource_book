<section class="paragraphs"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Project Administration.</span></h4>
<p>Generally there are not a lot of administrative things you can do with a single project, but there are a couple of items that might be of interest.</p>
<section class="paragraphs"><h5 class="heading"><span class="title">Changing the Default Branch.</span></h5>
<p>If you are using a branch other than “master” as your default branch that you want people to open Pull Requests on or see by default, you can change that in your repository’s settings page under the “Options” tab.</p>
<figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 100%; margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%;"><img src="external/github-maint-10-default-branch.png" class="contained"></div>
<figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">6.4.43<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span>Change the default branch for a project</figcaption></figure><p>Simply change the default branch in the dropdown and that will be the default for all major operations from then on, including which branch is checked out by default when someone clones the repository.</p></section><section class="paragraphs"><h5 class="heading"><span class="title">Transferring a Project.</span></h5>
<p>If you would like to transfer a project to another user or an organization in GitHub, there is a “Transfer ownership” option at the bottom of the same “Options” tab of your repository settings page that allows you to do this.</p>
<figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 100%; margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%;"><img src="external/github-maint-11-transfer.png" class="contained"></div>
<figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">6.4.44<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span>Transfer a project to another GitHub user or Organization</figcaption></figure><p>This is helpful if you are abandoning a project and someone wants to take it over, or if your project is getting bigger and want to move it into an organization.</p>
<p>Not only does this move the repository along with all its watchers and stars to another place, it also sets up a redirect from your URL to the new place. It will also redirect clones and fetches from Git, not just web requests.</p></section></section><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_git_github.html#_project_administration" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
