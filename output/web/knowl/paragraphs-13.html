<p></p>
<p>It is possible to use what we have learned thus far to make an executable script. A <dfn class="terminology">script</dfn> is a text file that contains a sequence of commands for the operating system. Shell scripts can be useful to bring together common sets of tasks and to make repetitive tasks faster and easier.</p>
<p>Let's try it! Typing <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">cat &gt;&gt; helloworld.sh</code> will tell the shell to open a new file named <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">helloworld.sh</code> and to expect multiple lines of input from the keyboard. Type the following lines:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">cat &gt;&gt; helloworld.sh
# This is a comment in a script typically used to explain the purpose
echo 'Hello World!'
</pre>
<p>End the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">cat &gt;&gt; helloworld.sh</code> command sequence by pressing <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">Ctrl+D</code> on your keyboard. This will cause the file named <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">helloworld.sh</code> to be completed and closed.</p>
<p>You should now have new file named  <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">helloworld.sh</code>. However, we would like to make it executable so we can run it as a script. To make it executable, we use the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">chmod</code> command. The <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">chmod</code> stands for <em class="emphasis">change file mode bits</em>.  To add execution, we will need the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">+x</code> option, which stands for 'add execution' and will change it to being executable. So, run the following in your shell to make it an executable file for all users:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">chmod +x helloworld.sh
</pre>
<p>To execute this script, you need to indicate the directory where to find it, which is the current directory. So, to run it, you can type the following:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">./helloworld.sh
</pre>
<p>We can create a more interactive script using the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">read</code> command which reads text from the keyboard. It is frequently used to make scripts interactive. However, we need a variable to store the result. In the shell, some variables, like environment variables, always exist and you can always access them. However, you can also create your own variables. As we have seen, you can use echo to ask the shell to provide the value of a variable, but you must precede the variable name with the dollar sign ($). Let's see how all this works by trying the following, finishing by pressing <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">Control+D</code>:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">cat &gt;&gt; hellouser.sh
# Says hello to the user by name.
echo 'What is your first name?'
# In the next line, USERNAME is dynamically created as a new variable
read USERNAME
echo "Hello " $USERNAME
</pre>
<p>To run this new script, you will again need to make it executable.  Then you can run it.</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">chmod +x hellouser.sh
./hellouser.sh
