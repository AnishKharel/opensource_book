<dfn class="terminology">Software that outlives its creator.</dfn> There are literally thousands and thousands of pieces of software, written for outdated computers, that are no longer useful for any purpose. If we had source code for these pieces of software, we might be able to extend them to new computers, making them continually more useful and more interesting — but because we don’t have the source code for these programs, we have very little use for them anymore. There’s a word for this kind of software: abandonware. In FOSS, there’s no such thing as <em class="emphasis">abandonware</em>. Sure, people may stop working on a piece of software, but the source is always there, ready to be picked up and carried forward by anyone who has the time and interest to do so. Every dead FOSS project has a chance to be reborn.</article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_share_code.html#li-12" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
