<div class="para">However, there are significant disadvantages to using local VCSs. For example, local VCSs do not support collaboration because multiple developers cannot easily work on the same codebase at the same time. So. local VCSs are more suited for individual developers who are working on their own projects. Local VCSs store code data locally, which increases the risk of data loss due to machine failure or corruption because whenever you have the entire history of a project in a single place, you risk losing everything. In addition, local systems are not scalable, so as the codebase grows in size, the performance of the local system may degrade.</div>
