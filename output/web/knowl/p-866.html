<div class="para">Once you have identified an OSS project with an active and welcoming community, what steps should you take to become involved? Communication is the key to a healthy community, so here are some steps you can take to begin:</div>
<ol class="decimal">
<li><div class="para">The first step is to learn to use the software. For web-based applications, this is often trivial. We all know how to use the Firefox browser, for example. For software that requires installation, you will likely follow directions on the website or in an INSTALL file from the repo. If needed, check out the examples and tutorials. Seeing an example of how the software works will help your understanding of the overall project.</div></li>
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">Asynchronous Communication Channels.</span></span><div class="para">Familiarize yourself with the communication channels employed by the community. If they have a Discord or Slack Channel, Google Group or other mailing list, sign up and read through other recent posts there. If this is a community, you want to stay engaged with, turn on notifications for some of the most relevant channels.</div>
</li>
<li><div class="para">Starting with the README, CONTRIBUTING, and CODE_OF_CONDUCT, read the documentation that seems most relevant to your goals.</div></li>
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">Following the Documentation.</span></span><div class="para">Because opening issues about unclear, incorrect, or out-of-date documentation is an excellent place to begin contributing, if you want to start contributing, follow the documentation very slowly and deliberately, taking note of places where you experience confusion.</div>
</li>
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">Synchronous Communication.</span></span><div class="para">Some groups also have IRC and/or drop in video conferences that are open to all. Once you have a sense of the community, you can drop into these which will help you to become more integrated into the community.</div>
</li>
<li><div class="para">Once you have something you want to contribute to the community, with the goal of setting up your development environment (see <a href="ch_dev_env.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 4: OSS Development Environment">ChapterÂ 4</a>),  slowly and deliberately follow the directions provided by the community to set up your development environment. Here again, take note of places where you experience confusion.</div></li>
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">Open an Issue.</span></span><div class="para">Once you have identified a place that documentation is confusing, wrong, etc, you are ready to open an issue. In opening an issue, most projects will have a standard format that you will want to be sure to follow.</div>
