<div class="para">Using a formal <dfn class="terminology">version control system (VCS)</dfn> has many advantages over using just an informal system of version control like the one we described in the last section. Some of the important advantages of VCSs include:</div>
<ul class="disc">
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">Versioning.</span></span><div class="para">They allow users to track changes to a codebase over time. Users can see why changes were made and can go back to a previous version of the code if needed.</div>
</li>
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">Collaboration.</span></span><div class="para">They allow multiple people to work on the same project at the same time, make changes to the code, and track the changes made by others. This facilitates collaboration.</div>
</li>
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">Branching and Merging.</span></span><div class="para">They allow users to create different branches of the codebase, which enables developers to work on separate features or fixes without affecting the main codebase. Once changes are completed and approved, the branches can be merged back into the main codebase.</div>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="para">For the examples in this chapter, we will use software source code as the files being version controlled, although in reality you can do this with nearly any type of file or set of files. For example, if you are a web site designer and want to keep every version of the site, a VCS is a very wise thing to use. It allows you to revert selected files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more. Using a VCS also generally means that if you mess things up or lose files, you can easily recover.</div>
