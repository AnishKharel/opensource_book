<div class="para">Some types of documentation utilize a particular structure often provided by the repository platform. We have discussed some of these earlier. Some very common kinds of documentation of this type are:</div>
<ul class="disc">
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">Automation of Builds and Publishing.</span></span><div class="para">While not used in all projects, larger OSS projects typically use CI/CD (continuous integration, delivery, and deployment) tools and processes in order to provide ongoing automation and continuous monitoring throughout the software lifecycle, from integration and testing phases to delivery and deployment.</div>
</li>
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">Bug and/or Issue Tracking.</span></span><div class="para">Bug and/or issue trackers provide tracking information for bugs or issues that have been identified in the project. They typically include related reports with steps to reproduce the issue or bug, the expected behavior, and the actual behavior. More about bug and issue trackers is covered in <a href="sec_issues_bugs.html" class="internal" title="Section 6.4: Issue and Bug Documentation">Section 6.4</a>.</div>
</li>
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">Editing and Review.</span></span><div class="para">As we learned in <a href="sec_git_github.html" class="internal" title="Section 5.6: GitHub - Git in the Cloud">Section 5.6</a>,  Software Engineering Collaboration Platforms like Github provide a forum for code reviews, proposed edits, proposed updates, and discussions of these via merge or pull requests. These are also a dedicated forum for discussing a proposed feature or bug fix.</div>
</li>
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">Project Management.</span></span><div class="para">Certain project management tools, such as Kanban boards, GitHub Projects, Trello Boards, etc. are often be used to organize and track the progress of documentation-related tasks and issues. These tools typically provide a visual and flexible way to manage the workflow of creating, updating, and maintaining documentation within a OSS repository.</div>
</li>
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">Version control.</span></span><div class="para">Version control is documented through git or another VCS. See <a href="ch_git.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 5: Version Control with Git">Chapter 5</a> for more detail.</div>
