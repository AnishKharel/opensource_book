<div class="para">Unfortunately, most people do not even read the legal terms and conditions for software packages before accepting them. A 2017 study entitled <a class="external" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/deloitte-study-91-percent-agree-terms-of-service-without-reading-2017-11?op=1" target="_blank">You’re not alone, no one reads terms of service agreements</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-22-hidden.html" title="Footnote 1.2.2"><sup> 2 </sup></a> found that over 90% of people do not read these statements before agreeing to them. Honestly, I am shocked that statistic is not even higher... So, everyone who does not read these is at the mercy of the developers, which might or might not be a safe choice. Open source should matter to those who do not read these license agreements because they and others can look at the source code.</div>
