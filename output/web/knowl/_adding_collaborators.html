If Ben, Jeff, and Louise all sign up for accounts on GitHub, and you want to give them push access to your repository, you can add them to your project. Doing so will give them “push” access, which means they have both read and write access to the project and Git repository.</div>  <div class="para">Click the “Settings” link at the bottom of the right-hand sidebar.</div> <div class="para">Then select “Collaborators” from the menu on the left-hand side. Then, just type a username into the box, and click “Add collaborator.” You can repeat this as many times as you like to grant access to everyone you like. If you need to revoke access, just click the “X” on the right-hand side of their row.</div> </section><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_git_github.html#_adding_collaborators" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
