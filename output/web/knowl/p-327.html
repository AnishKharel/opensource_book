<p><dfn class="terminology">Containerization</dfn> is a method of operating system virtualization that packages an application and its dependencies into a single self contained unit called a <dfn class="terminology">container</dfn>, which can be run on any host machine with the appropriate software. Containers are lightweight and fast because they share the host machine's operating system and do not require their own operating system to be installed like VMs do. This makes containers highly portable, as well as easier to manage and deploy.</p>
