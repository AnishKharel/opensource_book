<p>Note: Though Pull Requests are used commonly for public projects when the contributor has a complete change ready to be made, it’s also often used in internal projects <em class="emphasis">at the beginning</em> of the development cycle. Since you can keep pushing to the topic branch even <dfn class="terminology">after</dfn> the Pull Request is opened, it’s often opened early and used as a way to iterate on work as a team within a context, rather than opened at the very end of the process.</p>
