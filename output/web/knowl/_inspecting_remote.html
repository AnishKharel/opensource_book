<p>If you want to see more information about a particular remote, you can use the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git remote show &lt;remote&gt;</code> command. If you run this command with a particular shortname, such as <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">origin</code>, you get something like this:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">$ git remote show origin
* remote origin
  Fetch URL: https://github.com/schacon/ticgit
  Push  URL: https://github.com/schacon/ticgit
  HEAD branch: master
  Remote branches:
    master                               tracked
    dev-branch                           tracked
  Local branch configured for 'git pull':
    master merges with remote master
  Local ref configured for 'git push':
    master pushes to master (up to date)
</pre>
<p>It lists the URL for the remote repository as well as the tracking branch information. The command helpfully tells you that if you’re on the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">master</code> branch and you run <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git pull</code>, it will automatically merge the remote’s <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">master</code> branch into the local one after it has been fetched. It also lists all the remote references it has pulled down.</p>
<p>That is a simple example you’re likely to encounter. When you’re using Git more heavily, however, you may see much more information from <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git remote show</code>:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">$ git remote show origin
* remote origin
  URL: https://github.com/my-org/complex-project
  Fetch URL: https://github.com/my-org/complex-project
  Push  URL: https://github.com/my-org/complex-project
  HEAD branch: master
  Remote branches:
    master                           tracked
    dev-branch                       tracked
    markdown-strip                   tracked
    issue-43                         new (next fetch will store in remotes/origin)
    issue-45                         new (next fetch will store in remotes/origin)
    refs/remotes/origin/issue-11     stale (use 'git remote prune' to remove)
  Local branches configured for 'git pull':
    dev-branch merges with remote dev-branch
    master     merges with remote master
  Local refs configured for 'git push':
    dev-branch                     pushes to dev-branch                     (up to date)
    markdown-strip                 pushes to markdown-strip                 (up to date)
    master                         pushes to master                         (up to date)
</pre>
<p>This command shows which branch is automatically pushed to when you run <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git push</code> while on certain branches. It also shows you which remote branches on the server you don’t yet have, which remote branches you have that have been removed from the server, and multiple local branches that are able to merge automatically with their remote-tracking branch when you run <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">git pull</code>.</p></section><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_git_basics.html#_inspecting_remote" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
