<p>This is where distributed version control systems (DVCS) step in. In a DVCS (such as Git, Mercurial, Bazaar or Darcs), clients don’t just check out the latest snapshot of the files; rather, they fully mirror the repository, including its full history. Thus, if any server dies, and these systems were collaborating via that server, any of the client repositories can be copied back up to the server to restore it. Every clone is really a full backup of all the data.</p>

This allows you to set up several types of workflows that aren’t possible in centralized systems, such as hierarchical models.</p></section><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_git_getting_started.html#sec_distributed_version_control_systems" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
