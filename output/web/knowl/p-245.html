<p>Given that Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) came into widespread use decades ago, it may seem surprising that nearly all software developers utilize a non-graphical shell. The primary reasons for this include:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">Speed of Use.</span></span><p>The speed one can type a command is typically many times faster than the speed at which one can select a command from a menu.</p>
</li>
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">Expressiveness.</span></span><p>The shell facilitates features that are unavailable or difficult to access in a GUI. The mouse only allows for picking among the small set of predetermined options from the screen. However, for most systems many more options are actually available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">Automation.</span></span><p>If you need to do something that is repetitive or requires combining multiple commands, the shell facilitates this too since shells can be programmed using a scripting language, allowing repetitive and/or complex tasks to be automated via a script.</p>
</li>
</ul>
