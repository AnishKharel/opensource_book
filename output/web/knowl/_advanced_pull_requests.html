<section class="paragraphs"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Advanced Pull Requests.</span></h4>  <div class="para">Now that we’ve covered the basics of contributing to a project on GitHub, let’s cover a few interesting tips and tricks about Pull Requests so you can be more effective in using them.</div>  <section class="paragraphs"><h5 class="heading"><span class="title">Pull Requests as Patches.</span></h5>  <div class="para">It’s important to understand that many projects don’t really think of Pull Requests as queues of perfect patches that should apply cleanly in order, as most mailing list-based projects think of patch series contributions. Most GitHub projects think about Pull Request branches as iterative conversations around a proposed change, culminating in a unified diff that is applied by merging.</div>  <div class="para">This is an important distinction, because generally the change is suggested before the code is thought to be perfect. This depends wholely on the community. In communities where it is used, it enables an earlier conversation with the maintainers so that arriving at the proper solution is more of a community effort. When code is proposed with a Pull Request and the maintainers or community suggest a change, the patch series is generally not re-rolled, but instead the difference is pushed as a new commit to the branch, moving the conversation forward with the context of the previous work intact.</div>  <div class="para">This way if you go back and look at this Pull Request in the future, you can easily find all of the context of why decisions were made. Pushing the “Merge” button on the site purposefully creates a merge commit that references the Pull Request so that it’s easy to go back and research the original conversation if necessary.</div> </section> <section class="paragraphs"><h5 class="heading"><span class="title">Keeping up with Upstream.</span></h5>  <div class="para">If your Pull Request becomes out of date or otherwise doesn’t merge cleanly, you will want to fix it so the maintainer can easily merge it. GitHub will test this for you and let you know at the bottom of every Pull Request if the merge is trivial or not.</div>  <div class="para">If your Pull Request does not merge cleanly you’ll want to fix your branch so that it turns green.</div>  <div class="para">You have two main options in order to do this. You can either rebase your branch on top of whatever the target branch is (normally the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">main</code> branch of the repository you forked), or you can merge the target branch into your branch.</div>  <div class="para">Most developers on GitHub will choose to do the latter, for the same reasons we just went over in the previous section. What matters is the history and the final merge, so rebasing isn’t getting you much other than a slightly cleaner history and in return is <dfn class="terminology">far</dfn> more difficult and error prone.</div>  <div class="para">If you want to merge in the target branch to make your Pull Request mergeable, you would add the original repository as a new remote, fetch from it, merge the main branch of that repository into your topic branch, fix any issues and finally push it back up to the same branch you opened the Pull Request on.</div>  <div class="para logical"><ol class="decimal">
<li><div class="para">Add the original repository as a remote named <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">upstream</code>.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Fetch the newest work from that remote.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Merge the main branch of that repository into your topic branch.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Fix the conflict that occurred.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Push back up to the same topic branch.</div></li>
</ol></div>  <div class="para">Once you do that, the Pull Request will be automatically updated and re-checked to see if it merges cleanly.</div>  <div class="para">One of the great things about Git is that you can do that continuously. If you have a very long-running project, you can easily merge from the target branch over and over again and only have to deal with conflicts that have arisen since the last time that you merged, making the process very manageable.</div>  <div class="para">If you absolutely wish to rebase the branch to clean it up, you can certainly do so, but it is highly encouraged to not force push over the branch that the Pull Request is already opened on. If other people have pulled it down and done more work on it, you will run into major problems! Instead, push the rebased branch to a new branch on GitHub and open a brand new Pull Request referencing the old one, then close the original.</div> </section> <section class="paragraphs"><h5 class="heading"><span class="title">References.</span></h5>  <div class="para">Your next question may be “How do I reference the old Pull Request?”. It turns out there are many, many ways to reference other things almost anywhere you can write in GitHub.</div>  <div class="para">Let’s start with how to cross-reference another Pull Request or an Issue. All Pull Requests and Issues are assigned numbers and they are unique within the project. For example, you can’t have Pull Request #3 <em class="emphasis">and</em> Issue #3. If you want to reference any Pull Request or Issue from any other one, you can simply put <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">#&lt;num&gt;</code> in any comment or description. You can also be more specific if the Issue or Pull request lives somewhere else; write <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">username#&lt;num&gt;</code> if you’re referring to an Issue or Pull Request in a fork of the repository you’re in, or <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">username/repo#&lt;num&gt;</code> to reference something in another repository.</div>  <div class="para">In addition to issue numbers, you can also reference a specific commit by SHA-1. You have to specify a full 40 character SHA-1, but if GitHub sees that in a comment, it will link directly to the commit. Again, you can reference commits in forks or other repositories in the same way you did with issues.</div> </section></section><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_git_github.html#_advanced_pull_requests" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
