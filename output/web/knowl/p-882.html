<p>Some projects also differentiate <dfn class="terminology">defect</dfn>, from bug. A defect refers to a flaw or problem in software that leads to undesired behavior. However, the term defect is sometimes used in a broader sense to encompass not only software errors but also issues related to design, architecture, documentation, or other aspects of the software development process. Defects can be thought of as any deviation from the expected quality standards or requirements of the project. They can include functional or non-functional issues that impact the overall performance, usability, security, or reliability of the software.</p>
