<p>The Internet has changed the way we ask questions. Billions of people can now go to a web page, ask almost any imaginable question, and get some kind of response — maybe right, maybe dramatically wrong, but some kind of response. It is this experience that is, in no small part, why the word “google” is now a verb. Alice, without realizing it, will quickly move from a “User” of Inkscape to a “Seeker” of information.</p>
<p>Our friend Alice has a problem. She has an Inkscape file with lots of cool images that some of her friends have made, and she wants to use them as part of a new illustration she’s working on. But when she opens that file, and then tries to cut and paste into a new document, Inkscape crashes. Well, it crashes <em class="emphasis">sometimes</em>. And this unpredictability is becoming annoying — so Alice goes to her favorite online anime discussion forum to ask her friends if they’re seeing this problem.</p>
<p>One friend recommends that she go ask on the Inkscape developers mailing list. Another friend recommends that she file a bug. A third friend asks for more details: when does it happen? Does it happen randomly, or can she make it happen by doing a particular thing over and over? Then another person pops up and says that yes, he’s had that problem too, but he works around it by opening his documents in a certain order. After some back-and-forth with this new friend, trying to figure out exactly what he means, Alice figures out the workaround: no more crashes! Alice thanks everyone for their help and gets back to her project.</p>
<p>Alice has become a seeker. By looking for answers, Alice has discovered a broad community of people who are willing to help her figure out how to do things a better way.</p></section><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_contributor_mountain.html#seeker" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
