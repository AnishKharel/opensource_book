<p>Your next question may be “How do I reference the old Pull Request?”. It turns out there are many, many ways to reference other things almost anywhere you can write in GitHub.</p>
<p>Let’s start with how to cross-reference another Pull Request or an Issue. All Pull Requests and Issues are assigned numbers and they are unique within the project. For example, you can’t have Pull Request #3 <em class="emphasis">and</em> Issue #3. If you want to reference any Pull Request or Issue from any other one, you can simply put <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">#&lt;num&gt;</code> in any comment or description. You can also be more specific if the Issue or Pull request lives somewhere else; write <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">username#&lt;num&gt;</code> if you’re referring to an Issue or Pull Request in a fork of the repository you’re in, or <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">username/repo#&lt;num&gt;</code> to reference something in another repository.</p>
<p>In addition to issue numbers, you can also reference a specific commit by SHA-1. You have to specify a full 40 character SHA-1, but if GitHub sees that in a comment, it will link directly to the commit. Again, you can reference commits in forks or other repositories in the same way you did with issues.</p></section><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_git_github.html#_references" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
