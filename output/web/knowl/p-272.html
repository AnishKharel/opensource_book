<p>One question you might have is whether you can use your existing machine to contribute to open source. The good news is that whether you are using Mac OS, Linux, or Windows you should be able to set up a development environment and access the CLI.</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">On a Mac.</span></span><p>If you are on a Mac, you will need to run the Terminal program to access the CLI.  Opening the Terminal on a Mac works like opening any other program: you can find it in the Applications folder, you can search for it, you can use the Launchpad, or you can use it's shortcut which is command(⌘)+T.</p>
</li>
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">In Linux.</span></span><p>In Linux, the CLI is also called the Terminal. You can access it in several ways: search for the keyword Terminal, right-click  on your desktop and then select "Open Terminal", or use the shortcut Ctrl+Alt+T.</p>
</li>
<li>
<span class="heading"><span class="title">In Windows.</span></span><p>If you are running Windows 11 or Windows 10 version 2004 or higher, then following the directions from Microsoft on <a class="external" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install" target="_blank">Installing Linux on Windows with WSL2</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-104-hidden.html" title="Footnote 5.1.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a> will give you the best experience because WSL2 provides a full Linux kernel that is integrated into the Windows operating system. Installing <a class="external" href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/install" target="_blank">the Windows Terminal</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-105-hidden.html" title="Footnote 5.1.2"><sup> 2 </sup></a> will further enhance your experience, although it is not strictly necessary. Once you have followed the linked directions to install WSL2 (including the installation of Linux) then the terminal is most easily accessed by searching for Terminal and choosing "Run Terminal". If you first need to update your Windows OS, see <a class="external" href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-update-faq-8a903416-6f45-0718-f5c7-375e92dddeb2" target="_blank"><code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-update-faq-8a903416-6f45-0718-f5c7-375e92dddeb2</code></a>.</p>
<p>If you are running an earlier version of Windows and cannot upgrade to Windows 10 version 2004 or higher, then using a Virtual Machine (VM) environment such as <a class="external" href="https://www.virtualbox.org/" target="_blank">Virtual Box</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-106-hidden.html" title="Footnote 5.1.3"><sup> 3 </sup></a> and installing and running Ubuntu in the VM is highly advisable.</p>

<span class="heading"><span class="title">Another OS.</span></span><p>Although Linux, Mac, and Windows (to a lesser extent) are by far the most typical development environments, developing in another OS environment might also be possible. For example, searching on "software development in ChromeOS" will provide several useful links for how to set up a development environment in ChromeOS. Just be aware that developing in another OS environment is likely to offer little in the way of support.</p>
