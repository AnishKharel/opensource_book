</h3> Any global community will of necessity include participants with different native languages. Large projects usually evolve collaborative subgroups that work on documentation and localization for specific languages, but contributors to code and base documentation need a common language in which they can communicate.

However, the fact that the reserved keywords and base documentation for many programming languages are in English may also be a critical factor. In Eric S.
