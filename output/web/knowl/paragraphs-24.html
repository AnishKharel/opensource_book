<section class="paragraphs"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">How Git is Organized.</span></h4> <div class="para"></div>  <div class="para">A Git repository is more than just a set of files. It is also more than just a set of snapshots of files. It’s a complete history of a project’s development, which includes information about who made what changes, when those changes were made, and why they were made because the repository includes not only the committed snapshots of files, but also the metadata that accompanies those snapshots, such as commit messages and author information. Additionally, the repository includes information about the branches and tags that have been created to manage the development of the project.</div> <div class="para">This leads us to three key components of a Git VCS: the Git working tree, the Git staging area, and the Git directory.</div> <figure class="figure figure-like"><div class="image-box" style="width: 100%; margin-left: 0%; margin-right: 0%;"><img src="external/areas.png" class="contained"></div>
<figcaption><span class="type">Figure</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">5.2.4<span class="period">.</span></span><span class="space"> </span>Git working tree, Git staging area, and Git directory</figcaption></figure> <div class="para">The <dfn class="terminology">Git working tree</dfn> refers to the set of files and directories that are currently being worked on in a local repository, but it is more than just the set of files and directories. It is also a service that continuously monitors the resource status of the files and the file system in that local repository. For example, the Git working tree logs when a new file is added or deleted or modified.</div> <div class="para">When you use stage changes, Git copies the changes from the modified files that are in the working tree to the staging area.</div>  <div class="para">The <dfn class="terminology">Git staging area</dfn>, also known as the <dfn class="terminology">Git index</dfn>, is a file where the changes to files that have been staged are stored and stand ready to be committed.</div> <div class="para">Once changes have been staged in the staging area, you can create a new commit. This then takes the staged changes and creates a new snapshot of the files in the Git directory.</div>  <div class="para">The <dfn class="terminology">Git directory</dfn> is where all the committed snapshots of the project are stored along with the associated metadata, such as commit messages and author information.  This is the most important part of Git. Along with the files and file directory, the Git directory is copied when you <em class="emphasis">clone</em> a repository from another computer.</div>  <div class="para">The basic Git workflow goes something like this:</div>  <div class="para logical"><ol class="decimal">
<li><div class="para">You modify files in your working tree.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">You selectively stage just those changes you want to be part of your next commit, which adds <em class="emphasis">only</em> those changes to the staging area.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">You then do a commit, which takes the files as they are in the staging area and stores that snapshot permanently to your local Git directory (on your computer). Note that in <a href="sec_git_github.html" class="internal" title="Section 5.6: GitHub - Git in the Cloud">Section 5.6</a>, we will learn how to push your work to a remote copy of the repository.</div></li>
</ol></div>  <div class="para">If a particular version of a file is in the Git directory, it’s considered <em class="emphasis">committed</em>. If it has been modified and was added to the staging area, it is <em class="emphasis">staged</em>. And if it was changed since it was checked out but has not been staged, it is <em class="emphasis">modified</em>. In  <a href="sec_git_basics.html" class="internal" title="Section 5.3: Git Basics">Section 5.3</a> you’ll learn more about these states and how you can either take advantage of them or skip the staged part entirely.</div></section><span class="incontext"><a href="sec_git_getting_started.html#paragraphs-24" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
