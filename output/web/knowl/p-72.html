<p>The challenges of decompilation and the potential security risks inherent in programs that are closed source led the Research Directorate of the US National Security Agency (NSA) to develop a suite of open source reverse engineering and decompilation tools called <a class="external" href="https://ghidra-sre.org/" target="_blank">Ghidra</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-21-hidden.html" title="Footnote 1.3.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a>. That this work was developed by one of the top cybersecurity agencies in the world and that they released and maintain it as open source software stands as a very strong testimonial to both the potential security concerns inherent in closed source software and to the potential security benefits of open source software.</p>
