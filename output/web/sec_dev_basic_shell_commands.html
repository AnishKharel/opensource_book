</h4></a></article><div class="hidden-content tex2jax_ignore" id="hk-exercise-try-cli"><article class="exercise exercise-like"><p id="p-263">Try each of the following commands on your own machine.</p></article></div>
<p id="p-264">First, follow the directions given in <a href="sec_dev_shell_terms.html#subsec-getting_terminal" class="internal" title="Subsection 4.1.3: Accessing a Terminal Window on your Machine">Subsection 4.1.3</a> to open a terminal window so you can use your shell. All of the shell commands will be typed in this terminal window.</p>
<section class="paragraphs" id="paragraphs-6"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Introduction to Shell Commands.</span></h4>
<p id="p-265"></p>
<p id="p-266">Shell commands are simply commands that are typed into the shell. As our very first shell command to try, let's try the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">echo</code> command which simply echos or displays the argument(s) to the terminal.  Try the following with or without the quotes:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">echo "I love open source!"
</pre>
<p id="p-267">You should have seen the text "I love open source!" printed in the terminal. Now if that were all the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">echo</code> command could do, it would be a fairly pointless command. The <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">echo</code> command's real power is in displaying the contents of variables and files as we will soon see.</p>
<p id="p-268">The shell is designed to work in an OS which is a multi-user environment. Type in the following command to see your username:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">whoami
</pre>
<p id="p-269">The shell should respond with the username that you created when you set up your system.  For me that is <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">pearcej</code>.</p>
<p id="p-270">Note that your environment might be <dfn class="terminology">case sensitive</dfn>, which means that it might discriminate between uppercase and lowercase letters, where two words that in letter cases only, are not considered equal. This means that <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">Echo</code>, <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">ECHO</code>, <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">WhoAmI</code>, and <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">WHOAMI</code>  might not be recognized as commands, so you are in a case sensitive environment and accidentally type one of these, you will elicit a response like:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">Command 'WhoAmI' not found
</pre>
<p id="p-271">or if you are in a case sensitive environment and you are lucky, you might get something more helpful like:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">Command 'Echo' not found, did you mean:
    command 'echo'
</pre>
<p id="p-272">Sometimes it is helpful to be able to remember some information or look up previously stored information. This can be accomplished using environment variables. An <dfn class="terminology">environment variable</dfn> is a value that contains information about the system environment or the currently logged-in user. Having environment variables is a way of keeping track of information about the system environment and serves as a way to pass information about the environment to programs. For example, the operating system sets a bunch of environment variables which store information about the environment. As just one example, you might wonder how the operating system keeps track of its users. For each user, there is a user environment variable called USER that is specific only to the currently logged-in user. The shell will expand environment variables and that `echo` is useful to show us the results of that, so the USER environment variable can be accessed using the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">echo</code> command that we already saw.  Try the following:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">echo $USER
</pre>
<p id="p-273">You should see the same result as you saw with the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">whoami</code> command! Note that you must precede the variable name with a dollar sign $ whenever you reference the value it contains. Isn't it interesting to peek inside the environment variable in that way?</p>
<p id="p-274">In fact, one of the key uses of the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">echo</code> command is to echo the values of variables, which the shell can expand. Let's see another example:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">echo $SHELL
</pre>
<p id="p-275">You will likely see something like the following printed:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">/bin/bash
</pre>
<p id="p-276">The reason you see something like this is because the SHELL environment variable stores the location of the shell program. This location, called the <dfn class="terminology">file path</dfn>, is given in the form of the path needed to find the location. We explore how this path is described in the next section.</p></section><section class="paragraphs" id="paragraphs-7"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Files and File Systems.</span></h4>
<p id="p-277"></p>
<p id="p-278">Before computers became popular, a <dfn class="terminology">file</dfn> and a <dfn class="terminology">folder</dfn> referred to a container for a collection of documents. Operating systems use these terms very similarly. A file refers to a document and a folder or, synonymously, a <dfn class="terminology">directory</dfn> refers to a collection of files and sub-directories. The operating system handles how files and directories are represented on a physical storage medium, how they are read from, and written to. You may be most familiar with accessing files through a graphical user interface. Creating a new document corresponds to creating a new file. Often, when opening an application that deals with documents, it will suggest documents you have recently worked with. These each correspond to a file, each of which is stored in a directory somewhere, and knowing where files are in your file directory will be important to working on open source.</p>
<p id="p-279">You might (or might not) be familiar with using folders to organize our files and to navigate the file system. (On an iphone or Android phone, you make a new folder by dropping one app on top of another app, on a Mac you long press and then choose new folder, and on a Windows machine, you right-click and choose New &gt; folder.) This type of organization is important to understand, and the folder metaphor is useful. In fact, there are two useful metaphors to help with our understanding of file systems.</p>
<p id="p-280">When using the shell,  "folders" are more typically called "directories", but the two terms are equivalent.</p>
<p id="p-281">Inside of a directory, we can find files and possibly additional directories. Since directories may contain other directories in addition to files, the directories on your computer form a hierarchy. Each directory is contained within another directory, which we refer to as its <dfn class="terminology">parent</dfn>. The only exception to this rule is the  <dfn class="terminology">root directory</dfn>, which can be a parent to other directories, but has no parent itself. It is therefore the top-level directory from which we can reach any other directory. Each file and directory in the file system can be referred to by its unique <dfn class="terminology">path</dfn>. The root directory always has the path <dfn class="terminology">/</dfn>, and a file can thus be identified by its path through the file system beginning from the root node. If there is a folder named <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">myfolder</code> located in the root directory, its path would be <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">/myfolder</code>. If <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">myfolder</code> then contains a file named <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">hello.txt</code>, its path would be <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">/myfolder/hello.txt</code>. If <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">/myfolder</code> contains a directory named <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">/mydocuments</code>, its path would be <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">/myfolder/mydocuments</code>. And so on." </p>
<p id="p-282">Note that the term <em class="emphasis">root directory</em> shouldn't be confused with the term <em class="emphasis">root user</em> in a Linux-like system. The <dfn class="terminology">root user</dfn> is a user named <em class="emphasis">root</em>, which is a special superuser account in Linux operating systems that has unrestricted read and write privileges to everything. The <em class="emphasis">root directory</em> should also not be confused with the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">/root</code> folder which is found on some Linux-based systems and which is the home directory of the root superuser.</p>
<p id="p-283">Let's get our bearings and see which directory we are currently in. The <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">pwd</code> command stands for <em class="emphasis">print working directory</em> and as the name says it prints the path of the directory you are working in. Try typing:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">pwd
</pre>
<p id="p-284">When I type this, I see the following (but you will likely see a different path):</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">/home/pearcej
</pre>
<p id="p-285">Reading the path from right to left, using the folder metaphor, this means I am in a directory named <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">pearcej</code> which itself is a inside of a directory called <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">home</code> which is itself inside of the root directory, <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">/</code>. Note that the position with respect to the forward slash <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">/</code> tells us the direction of the relationship – further to the right is further inside.  To use the tree terminology, a directory that has a file or second directory directly inside of it is called a <dfn class="terminology">parent</dfn> of the file or second directory that is inside, while the file or second directory is called the <dfn class="terminology">child</dfn> of the parent directory. Hence, <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">pearcej</code>  is a child of <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">home</code> and <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">home</code> is a child of the root directory <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">/</code> in our example.</p>
<p id="p-286">Let's try "moving" (i.e. changing our working directory) to the root directory. Use the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">cd</code> command which stands for <em class="emphasis">change directory</em> followed by the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">/</code>:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">cd /

<p id="p-287">This should transport you to the <dfn class="terminology">root directory</dfn> (if you weren't there already.) Now when you use <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">pwd</code>, you should see <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">/</code> echoed back.</p>

<p id="p-291">Many shell commands have options which can be invoked by using a <dfn class="terminology">command option</dfn>, which is also called a <dfn class="terminology">flag</dfn>. Let's try using a command option with <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">ls</code>, the listing command. Try typing the following where the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">-r</code> option stands for <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">reverse</code>, and it reverses the sorting order:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">ls -r

<p id="p-292">To try another, try typing the following where the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">-l</code> option stands for <em class="emphasis">long listing format</em>, meaning that instead of output containing only the names of files and directories, the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">ls</code> command will produce additional information, assuming you have at least one file or directory.</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">ls -l

<p id="p-293">You are likely to see some lines that look something like this, each of which corresponds to one file or subdirectory in your current working directory. The exact output you get will vary based on the directory you are in and what files and folders exist on your machine:</p>

<p id="p-298">The last item on each of these lines is the filename itself. The first item in each of the lines is a 10 character-long mix of letters and minus signs. The first character of that set indicates the file type where <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">d</code> tells us it is a directory, <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">l</code> indicates it is a symbolic link, and <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">-</code> indicates it is a regular file. (Note that a <dfn class="terminology">symbolic link</dfn>, aka <dfn class="terminology">symlink</dfn> or <dfn class="terminology">soft link</dfn> is a special type of file that acts as a shortcut by pointing to some other file or directory.) The next nine characters display various permissions for the file. The first set of three characters (characters 2-4) are the user's (i.e. the file owner's) permissions, the next three are the group's permissions, and the last three are the permissions for all others. (The user's name  is in the third column and the group name is in the fourth column.) In each of these sets of three characters, the three characters refer to read (<code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">r</code>), write (<code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">w</code>), and execute (<code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">x</code>) respectively. If you see a letter then that permission is allowed, and if you see a '-', the permission is disallowed. For example in the last of the three lines shown above, we see that the file <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">hello.txt</code> has permissions of <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">-rw-rw-r--</code>. This means this is a file that can be read and written (changed) but not executed by the owner <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">pearcej</code> and also by any user who is a member of the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">friends</code> group, however other users can only read the file.</p>
<p id="p-299">Occasionally, you need to change permissions of a file. For example, you might need to change permissions to make a file executable. Changing file permissions is done with the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">chmod</code> command. We will explore this in a bit.</p></section><section class="paragraphs" id="paragraphs-10"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Learning More About Command Options.</span></h4>
<p id="p-300"></p>
<p id="p-301">If you want to see all of the command options for a given command, there are two different methods for many commands. You can often, but not always, use the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">--help</code> option on the command or you can use the <dfn class="terminology">manual</dfn> which is accessed using the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">man</code> command. For example, with the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">ls</code> command, you can use either one of the following, noting that they work a bit differently because the manual may use paging. If it does, to go to the next page use the space bar.</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">ls --help
man ls
</pre>
<p id="p-302">Note that since both <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">--help</code> and <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">man</code> are not consistently both available, it is worth knowing both. That way, if one doesn't work, you can try the other.</p>
<p id="p-303">You may be wondering about the use of one minus sign '-' vs the use of two minus signs '--' in shell options. One minus sign is typically used for single letter commands, while two is typically used for word-length commands, although even this is not a hard and fast rule. You'll occasionally get programs that also use a single `-` for word-length commands. If you look back at the help and/or manual results for <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">ls</code>, you may see that the options <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">-a</code> and <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">--all</code> both list all files including that begin with a '.', which are the hidden files  and directories. Besides brevity, one advantage the single minus sign often offers, is that to run multiple options at the same time, all you often need to do is concatenate them. Note that this is also program-specific; not all programs will allow this, but it is convenient when it is offered! For example, <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">ls -lra</code> returns the result with  the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">-l</code>,  <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">-r</code>, and <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">-a</code> option flags all activated. Give it a try!</p>

<p id="p-305">Next, let's go to your <dfn class="terminology">home</dfn> directory which is referenced by the special tilde '~' character as follows: </p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">cd ~
</pre>
<p id="p-306">Then print your working directory and list your files just to see that you have been transported again.</p>
<p id="p-307">You can make a new directory using the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">mkdir</code> command. For example, let's say you want to make a new directory with the name <em class="emphasis">newdir</em>, you can type the following:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">mkdir newdir
</pre>
<p id="p-308">To check that the directory was created as expected, you can get a fresh listing of your files and directories with <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">ls -l</code>. The output should include a line that ends in `newdir`. Try it!</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">drwxr-xr-x  2 pearcej pearcej   4096 Nov 15 17:00 newdir

<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">cd newdir
pwd
</pre>
<p id="p-310">You should note that your working directory has changed! One might expect not to see anything when running the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">ls</code> command in an empty directory, but try it with the following options:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">ls -la
</pre>
<p id="p-311">You are likely to see something like the following:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">drwxr-xr-x  2 pearcej pearcej 4096 Nov 16 17:00 .

<p id="p-312">Note the period at the end of the first line where the filename is expected. A period or dot (.) represents the current directory. The double period or double dot (..) represents the parent directory of the current one. </p>
<p id="p-313">You can use this dot notation as a reference as well, so <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">ls ..</code>, will list all the files and directories in the parent directory relative to where you are so you don't have to change directories to get the listing from another directory. Try it!</p>
<p id="p-314">You can even use these dots in combination with folder names. For example, if you are inside of the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">newdir</code> directory and you want to make a sibling directory called <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">newdir2</code>, you can type the following:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">mkdir ../newdir2
ls -l ..
</pre>
<p id="p-315">Here, the first command creates a new directory named <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">newdir2</code> as a child of our current parent directory. This makes <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">newdir2</code> a sibling of the original <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">newdir</code> directory because both have the same parent directory. The second line produces a long listing of all of the files and directories in the directory that is one level up relative to the current working  directory. You should see both of the directories that you made listed as subdirectories.</p>
<p id="p-316">If you want to delete either of these new empty directories, you can use the <dfn class="terminology">remove directory</dfn> command, <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">rmdir</code> followed by the name of the directory you want to remove. Note that there are other ways to remove directories, but <dfn class="terminology">remove directory</dfn> is useful because it refuses to delete a directory that is not empty. Give it a try!</p>
<p id="p-317">A handy use of the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">cd</code> command is to use <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">cd -</code> which  will take you to your previous working directory. This is handy if you need to move between two distant locations. Try it followed by <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">pwd</code>a couple of times.</p>

</pre></section><section class="paragraphs" id="paragraphs-12"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Input and Output Redirection.</span></h4>
<p id="p-318"></p>
<p id="p-319">There are a number of ways one can create a new file. Let's try some. First, use <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">cd</code> to descend into one of your new directories if you are not already in one so that you are in an empty directory. Then let's try the following commands:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">touch newfile1.txt
echo 'I love open source!' &gt; newfile2.txt
echo 'I really love open source!' &gt;&gt; newfile3.txt
ls
</pre>
<p id="p-320">You should now see three new files named <em class="emphasis">newfile1.txt</em>, <em class="emphasis">newfile2.txt</em>, and <em class="emphasis">newfile3.txt</em> respectively. This particular usage of the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">touch</code> command simply makes an empty file if no file by that name already exists in the directory. It is a niche use case for the command, but people use it this way with regularity. The intended purpose of the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">touch</code> changes the last accessed/modified date. Understanding the result of the first line we typed is pretty straightforward. The second and third lines that we typed require a bit more explanation. As we learned  above, the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">echo</code> command simply outputs (or echoes) the argument(s) to the terminal, but here the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">echo</code> command has been used in combination with output redirection into a file.</p>
<p id="p-321"><dfn class="terminology">Output redirection</dfn> is a feature in the shell that allows the user to redirect the output of a command using <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">&gt;</code> or <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">&gt;&gt;</code>. Recall that the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">echo</code> command normally prints to the screen. What we did above in creating new files with the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">echo</code> command was to use output redirection to redirect the output of the command into a file of the specified name. So, the command <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">echo 'I love open source!' &gt; newfile2.txt</code> redirected the output of the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">echo</code> command into the <em class="emphasis">newfile2.txt</em> file. Both <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">&gt;</code> and <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">&gt;&gt;</code> will create a <em class="emphasis">new</em> file with the provided name if one does not already exist. Note that the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">&gt;</code> is the output redirection operator used for <em class="emphasis">overwriting</em> a file that might or might not already exist, while the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">&gt;&gt;</code> is an output operator that <em class="emphasis">appends</em> the output to an existing file or creates a new one if one does not already exist.  So, <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">&gt;</code> should be used judiciously!</p>
<p id="p-322">Let's look at the contents of the files that we created. Let's use <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">cat</code> to see the file contents. Type the following one at a time:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">cat newfile1.txt
cat newfile2.txt
cat newfile3.txt
</pre>
<p id="p-323">You might be wondering why we are using a command called <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">cat</code>. The <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">cat</code> command, which stands for <em class="emphasis">concatenate</em>, is used to concatenate standard input (typically the keyboard) or file(s) to the standard output. Like the name suggests, you can also use the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">cat</code> command to concatenate files. For example, if you try:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">cat newfile2.txt newfile3.txt &gt; newfile1.txt
cat newfile1.txt
</pre>
<p id="p-324">You should see that <em class="emphasis">newfile1.txt</em> instead of being empty, now contains the concatenation of <em class="emphasis">newfile2.txt</em> and <em class="emphasis">newfile3.txt</em></p>
<p id="p-325">You can also use the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">cat</code> command in combination with output redirection to create a multi-line file. Try typing the following lines to create a new multi-line file named <em class="emphasis">newfile_multi.txt</em>:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">cat &gt; newfile_multi.txt
these
are
multiple
lines
</pre>
<p id="p-326">You can complete this command sequence by pressing <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">Control+D</code> on your keyboard which will cause the new file to be closed. You should now have a new file called <em class="emphasis">newfile_multi.txt</em>.</p>
<p id="p-327">Analogous to output redirection, <dfn class="terminology">input redirection</dfn> in the  shell using <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">&lt;</code> or <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">&lt;&lt;</code> allows you to redirect the input of a command.  So, if we want the response from a command to be written to a file instead of to the terminal, we can use output redirection, but if we want the input to a command to come from a file instead of from the keyboard, we use input redirection.</p>
<p id="p-328">Let's look at an example of input redirection using the  shell command <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">wc</code>, which stands for <em class="emphasis">word count</em>. This a command that as the name suggests can be used for counting. However, it does more than count words! It actually provides the line count, the word count, and the character count in the file(s) specified in the file arguments. By default, it displays all this in four-columnar output with the file name in the final column.</p>
<p id="p-329">Let's try the following:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">wc &lt; newfile2.txt
</pre>
<p id="p-330">The shell should reply with <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">1  4 20 newfile2.txt</code> because  <em class="emphasis">newfile2.txt</em> contains 'I love open source!' which is 1 line, 4 words, and 20 characters. If you only want to count the number of words, you could use the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">-w</code> flag to display only the word count as follows:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">wc -w  &lt; newfile2.txt
</pre>
<p id="p-331">Let's practice with input and output redirection using a temporary file. Let's redirect the output of the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">ls</code> command into a temporary file, and then use input redirection with <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">wc -w</code> to get the word count of this file. (This is one way to count the number of files in your current directory.) Let's try the following:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">ls &gt; temp.txt
wc -w &lt; temp.txt
</pre>
<p id="p-332">If you  are wondering if there is a better way than using a temporary file, there is. A <dfn class="terminology">pipe (|)</dfn> in the shell allows you to redirect (aka to pipe) the output of one command into the input of another command. Let's see an example:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">ls | wc -w
</pre>
<p id="p-333">Try it! This is an improvement because it is faster and avoids the use of a temporary file.</p></section><section class="paragraphs" id="paragraphs-13"><h4 class="heading"><span class="title">Scripts.</span></h4>
<p id="p-334"></p>
<p id="p-335">It is possible to use what we have learned thus far to make an executable script. A <dfn class="terminology">script</dfn> is a text file that contains a sequence of commands for the operating system. Shell scripts can be useful to bring together common sets of tasks and to make repetitive tasks faster and easier.</p>
<p id="p-336">Let's try it! Typing <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">cat &gt;&gt; helloworld.sh</code> will tell the shell to open a new file named <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">helloworld.sh</code> and to expect multiple lines of input from the keyboard. Type the following lines:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">cat &gt;&gt; helloworld.sh
# This is a comment in a script typically used to explain the purpose
echo 'Hello World!'
</pre>
<p id="p-337">End the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">cat &gt;&gt; helloworld.sh</code> command sequence by pressing <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">Ctrl+D</code> on your keyboard. This will cause the file named <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">helloworld.sh</code> to be completed and closed.</p>
<p id="p-338">You should now have new file named  <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">helloworld.sh</code>. However, we would like to make it executable so we can run it as a script. To make it executable, we use the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">chmod</code> command. The <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">chmod</code> stands for <em class="emphasis">change file mode bits</em>.  To add execution, we will need the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">+x</code> option, which stands for 'add execution' and will change it to being executable. So, run the following in your shell to make it an executable file for all users:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">chmod +x helloworld.sh
</pre>
<p id="p-339">To execute this script, you need to indicate the directory where to find it, which is the current directory. So, to run it, you can type the following:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">./helloworld.sh
</pre>
<p id="p-340">We can create a more interactive script using the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">read</code> command which reads text from the keyboard. It is frequently used to make scripts interactive. However, we need a variable to store the result. In the shell, some variables, like environment variables, always exist and you can always access them. However, you can also create your own variables. As we have seen, you can use echo to ask the shell to provide the value of a variable, but you must precede the variable name with the dollar sign ($). Let's see how all this works by trying the following, finishing by pressing <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">Control+D</code>:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">cat &gt;&gt; hellouser.sh
# Says hello to the user by name.
echo 'What is your first name?'
# In the next line, USERNAME is dynamically created as a new variable
read USERNAME
echo "Hello " $USERNAME
</pre>
<p id="p-341">To run this new script, you will again need to make it executable.  Then you can run it.</p>

<p id="p-343">We can  move files around, make copies of files, or remove (delete) files from the filesystem using <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">mv</code>, <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">cp</code>, and <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">rm</code> respectively. Let's see how these work. First, list your files.

<p id="p-344">Let's make a new directory named <em class="emphasis">subdir</em> below our current directory and move one of our files there.</p>

<p id="p-345">Note that the command <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">ls subdir</code> provides a listing of the subdirectory named <em class="emphasis">subdir</em>. You should see that newfile3.txt is now not in the current directory, but it is instead in the subdirectory <em class="emphasis">subdir</em>.</p>
<p id="p-346">In addition to moving files around in the directory structure, we can also use the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">mv</code> command to rename files as follows:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">mv newfile1.txt newfile4.txt
ls
</pre>
<p id="p-347">One important thing to watch out for with the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">mv</code> command is that if the destination filename already exists, it might get overwritten. For this reason, you might want to use the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">-i</code> flag which stands for interactive. Try it.</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">mv -i newfile1.txt newfile2.txt
</pre>
<p id="p-348">You should see a question like, "overwrite 'newfile2.txt'?"If you respond with "n", then the file will not be overwritten.</p>
<p id="p-349">The <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">cp</code> command works as you might expect:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">cp newfile2.txt newfile2_cp.txt

</pre>
<p id="p-350">Just like with the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">mv</code> command, the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">cp</code> command will overwrite the destination file if it already exists. For this reason, you might want to use the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">-i</code> flag which stands for interactive here too. Try it.</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">cp -i newfile4.txt newfile2_cp.txt

<p id="p-351">You should see a question like, "overwrite 'newfile2_cp.txt'?" If you respond with "n", the command will not be overwritten, so using the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">-i</code> flag seems a wise safeguard.</p>
<p id="p-352">The <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">rm</code> command is a useful, but another dangerous command.  Let's try it:</p>

<p id="p-353">Just as with <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">cp</code>, and <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">mv</code>, you are probably wise to use the <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">-i</code> option.</p>

<p id="p-356">The <em class="emphasis">up arrow</em> key retrieves the previous shell command. If you press it multiple times, it will take you back through multiple commands in your shell history. This is a useful way to repeat a command. For example, if you had a typo, you can use the up arrow, edit the command, and push enter to fix the command. Analogously, the <em class="emphasis">down arrow</em> will move you in the reverse direction through the shell command history. For more useful shell commands, type <code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">man bash</code> for hints on how to search your shell history, re-execute commands, and much more.</p>
<p id="p-357">This paragraph is intended to alert you to some useful search features. A couple examples of very common search patterns are using wildcards for zero or more characters or for a single character.  The asterisk (*) specifies zero or more characters to match. In bash the question mark (?) is used for matching exactly one single character.</p>
<p id="p-358">For example, if we type the following:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">rm -i newfile?.txt
</pre>
<p id="p-359">Then the question mark will match with any single character, and we will see the following prompts:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">rm: remove regular file 'newfile2.txt'?
rm: remove regular file 'newfile4.txt'?
</pre>
<p id="p-360">If we instead type:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">rm -i newfile*.txt
</pre>
<p id="p-361">Then the asterisk will match with any number of characters (including zero), and we will see the following prompts:</p>
<pre class="code-block tex2jax_ignore">rm: remove regular file 'newfile2.txt'?
rm: remove regular file 'newfile4.txt'?
rm: remove regular file 'newfile2_cp.txt'?
</pre>
<p id="p-362">As you can see, these search patterns give you a lot of power and control.</p></section></section><section class="conclusion" id="conclusion-5"><h3 class="heading">Conclusion.<span></span>
