  <title>Introduction to Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)</title>
  <introduction>
	<p>
		Open Source Software, or OSS for short, is software for which the source code can be shared, with anyone.
	</p>

	<p>
		There are more rigorous definitions, and there are many licenses that help to ensure these freedoms in subtly different ways. We examine these details later in <xref ref="ch3_licensing"/>. For now, focus on this simple idea: the freedom to share source code is the essential element of free and open source software.
