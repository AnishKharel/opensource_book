  <title>Introduction to Open Source Software (OSS)</title>
  <introduction>
	<p>
		Open Source Software (OSS) aka Free and Open Source Software (FOSS), is software for which the source code can be freely shared with anyone. (Note that the "free" n FOSS is related to the freedom to share the source code as opposed to being free of cost, which is might, or might not, be--more on this in the first section.)
	</p>

	<p>
		There are more rigorous definitions, and there are many licenses that help to ensure these freedoms in subtly different ways. We examine these details later in <xref ref="ch_licensing"/>. For now, focus on this simple idea: the freedom to share source code is the essential element of free and open source software.
