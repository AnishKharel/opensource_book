		<p> The most popular SECPs including <url href="https://github.com/" visual="github.com/">GitHub</url>, 
            <url href="https://gitea.io/" visual="gitea.io">Gitea</url>, 
            <url href="https://gitlab.com/" visual="gitlab.com/">GitLab</url>, and 
            <url href="https://bitbucket.org/" visual="bitbucket.org">Bitbucket</url> all use Git for version control and all provide cloud storage space for Git repositories. Of these, GitHub is the single largest host for Git repositories and is the central point of collaboration for millions of developers and projects. A large percentage of all Git repositories are hosted on GitHub, and many open-source projects use it for Git hosting, issue tracking, code review, and other things. So while it’s not a direct part of the Git open source project, there’s a good chance that you’ll want or need to interact with GitHub at some point while using Git professionally. Other hosting services work similarly.

			This section is about using GitHub effectively. We’ll cover signing up for and managing an account, creating and using Git repositories, common workflows to contribute to projects and to accept contributions to yours, GitHub’s programmatic interface and lots of little tips to make your life easier in general.

				<title>Forking Projects</title>

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					If you want to contribute to an existing project to which you don’t have write access (aka push access), you can <term>fork</term> the project. When you “fork” a project, GitHub will make a copy of the project that is entirely yours; it lives in your namespace, and you can push to it.
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="admonitionblock note"-->
				<p>
					Note: Historically, the term “fork” has been somewhat negative in context, meaning that someone took an open source project in a different direction, sometimes creating a competing project and splitting the contributors. In GitHub, a “fork” is simply the same project in your own namespace, allowing you to make changes to a project publicly as a way to contribute in a more open manner.
				</p>

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					This way, projects don’t have to worry about adding users as collaborators to give them push access. People can fork a project, push to it, and contribute their changes back to the original repository by creating a merge request which in GitHub is called a <term>pull request</term>. We’ll cover this next. Making a pull request opens up a discussion thread with code review, and the owner and the contributor can then communicate about the change until the owner is happy with it, at which point the owner can merge it in.
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					To fork a project, visit the project page and click the “Fork” button at the top-right of the page.
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->


<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					After a few seconds, you’ll be taken to your new project page, with your own writeable copy of the code.

				<title>The GitHub Flow</title>

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					GitHub is designed around a particular collaboration workflow, centered on pull requests. This flow works whether you’re collaborating with a tightly-knit team in a single shared repository, or a globally-distributed company or network of strangers contributing to a project through dozens of forks. This workflow is centered on the the idea of a branching workflow covered in <xref>sec_git_branching</xref>.
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->

					After you read any contributor's page and get a sense of the community norms, here’s how the Git park generally works:

						The only problem is that the blinking rate is too fast. We think it’s much nicer to wait 3 seconds instead of 1 in between each state change. So let’s improve the program and submit it back to the project as a proposed change.
					</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->

						First, we click the 'Fork' button as mentioned earlier to get our own copy of the project. Our user name here is “tonychacon” so our copy of this project is at <url href="https://github.com/tonychacon/blink"><c>https://github.com/tonychacon/blink</c></url> and that’s where we can edit it. We will clone it locally, create a topic branch, make the code change and finally push that change back up to GitHub.

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
					<p>
						Now if we go back to our fork on GitHub, we can see that GitHub noticed that we pushed a new topic branch up and presents us with a big green button to check out our changes and open a Pull Request to the original project.
					</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
					<p>
						You can alternatively go to the “Branches” page at <c>https://github.com/&lt;user&gt;/&lt;project&gt;/branches</c> to locate your branch and open a new Pull Request from there.
					</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
					<p>
						If we click that green button, we’ll see a screen that asks us to give our Pull Request a title and description. It is almost always worthwhile to put some effort into this, since a good description helps the owner of the original project determine what you were trying to do, whether your proposed changes are correct, and whether accepting the changes would improve the original project.
					</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
					<p>
						We also see a list of the commits in our topic branch that are “ahead” of the <c>main</c> or  <c>master</c> branch (in this case, just the one) and a unified diff of all the changes that will be made should this branch get merged by the project owner.

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
					<p>
						When you hit the 'Create pull request' button on this screen, the owner of the project you forked will get a notification that someone is suggesting a change and will link to a page that has all of this information on it.
					</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="admonitionblock note"-->

					<p>
						Note: Though Pull Requests are used commonly for public projects like this when the contributor has a complete change ready to be made, it’s also often used in internal projects <em>at the beginning</em> of the development cycle. Since you can keep pushing to the topic branch even <term>after</term> the Pull Request is opened, it’s often opened early and used as a way to iterate on work as a team within a context, rather than opened at the very end of the process.

						At this point, the project owner can look at the suggested change and merge it, reject it or comment on it. Let’s say that he likes the idea, but would prefer a slightly longer time for the light to be off than on.
					</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
					<p>
						Where this conversation may take place over email in the workflows presented in <url href="ch00/ch05-distributed-git">Distributed Git</url>, on GitHub this happens online. The project owner can review the unified diff and leave a comment by clicking on any of the lines.

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
					<p>
						Once the maintainer makes this comment, the person who opened the Pull Request (and indeed, anyone else watching the repository) will get a notification. We’ll go over customizing this later, but if he had email notifications turned on, Tony would get an email like this:
					</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= xml:id="_email_notification" class="imageblock"-->
<!-- div attr= class="content"-->
                    <figure xml:id="github-blink-04-email">

<!-- div attr= class="title"-->
<!--</div attr= class="title">--><!--</div attr= xml:id="_email_notification" class="imageblock">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
					<p>
						Anyone can also leave general comments on the Pull Request. In <url href="ch00/_pr_discussion">Pull Request discussion page</url> we can see an example of the project owner both commenting on a line of code and then leaving a general comment in the discussion section. You can see that the code comments are brought into the conversation as well.
					</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= xml:id="_pr_discussion" class="imageblock"-->
<!-- div attr= class="content"-->
                    <figure xml:id="github-blink-05-general-comment">

<!--</div attr= class="title">--><!--</div attr= xml:id="_pr_discussion" class="imageblock">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
					<p>
						Now the contributor can see what they need to do in order to get their change accepted. Luckily this is very straightforward. Where over email you may have to re-roll your series and resubmit it to the mailing list, with GitHub you simply commit to the topic branch again and push, which will automatically update the Pull Request. In <url href="ch00/_pr_final">Pull Request final</url> you can also see that the old code comment has been collapsed in the updated Pull Request, since it was made on a line that has since been changed.
					</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
					<p>
						Adding commits to an existing Pull Request doesn’t trigger a notification, so once Tony has pushed his corrections he decides to leave a comment to inform the project owner that he made the requested change.
					</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= xml:id="_pr_final" class="imageblock"-->
<!-- div attr= class="content"-->
                    <figure xml:id="github-blink-06-final">

<!-- div attr= class="title"-->
<!--</div attr= class="title">--><!--</div attr= xml:id="_pr_final" class="imageblock">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
					<p>
						An interesting thing to notice is that if you click on the “Files Changed” tab on this Pull Request, you’ll get the “unified” diff — that is, the total aggregate difference that would be introduced to your main branch if this topic branch was merged in. In <c>git diff</c> terms, it basically automatically shows you <c>git diff main&lt;branch&gt;</c> for the branch this Pull Request is based on. See 
						<url href="ch00/_what_is_introduced">Determining What Is Introduced</url> for more about this type of diff.
					</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
					<p>
						The other thing you’ll notice is that GitHub checks to see if the Pull Request merges cleanly and provides a button to do the merge for you on the server. This button only shows up if you have write access to the repository and a trivial merge is possible. If you click it GitHub will perform a “non-fast-forward” merge, meaning that even if the merge <term>could</term> be a fast-forward, it will still create a merge commit.
					</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
					<p>
						If you would prefer, you can simply pull the branch down and merge it locally. If you merge this branch into the <c>main</c> branch and push it to GitHub, the Pull Request will automatically be closed.
					</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
					<p>
						This is the basic workflow that most GitHub projects use. Topic branches are created, Pull Requests are opened on them, a discussion ensues, possibly more work is done on the branch and eventually the request is either closed or merged.
					</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="admonitionblock note"-->
					<p>
						Note: It’s important to note that you can also open a Pull Request between two branches in the same repository. If you’re working on a feature with someone and you both have write access to the project, you can push a topic branch to the repository and open a Pull Request on it to the <c>main</c> branch of that same project to initiate the code review and discussion process. No forking necessary.

				<title>Advanced Pull Requests</title>

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					Now that we’ve covered the basics of contributing to a project on GitHub, let’s cover a few interesting tips and tricks about Pull Requests so you can be more effective in using them.
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="sect4"-->

				<paragraphs xml:id="_pull_requests_as_patches">
					<title>Pull Requests as Patches</title>

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
					<p>
						It’s important to understand that many projects don’t really think of Pull Requests as queues of perfect patches that should apply cleanly in order, as most mailing list-based projects think of patch series contributions. Most GitHub projects think about Pull Request branches as iterative conversations around a proposed change, culminating in a unified diff that is applied by merging.
					</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
					<p>
						This is an important distinction, because generally the change is suggested before the code is thought to be perfect, which is far more rare with mailing list based patch series contributions. This enables an earlier conversation with the maintainers so that arriving at the proper solution is more of a community effort. When code is proposed with a Pull Request and the maintainers or community suggest a change, the patch series is generally not re-rolled, but instead the difference is pushed as a new commit to the branch, moving the conversation forward with the context of the previous work intact.
					</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
					<p>
						For instance, if you go back and look again at <url href="ch00/_pr_final">Pull Request final</url>, you’ll notice that the contributor did not rebase his commit and send another Pull Request. Instead they added new commits and pushed them to the existing branch. This way if you go back and look at this Pull Request in the future, you can easily find all of the context of why decisions were made. Pushing the “Merge” button on the site purposefully creates a merge commit that references the Pull Request so that it’s easy to go back and research the original conversation if necessary.

					<title>Keeping up with Upstream</title>

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
					<p>
						If your Pull Request becomes out of date or otherwise doesn’t merge cleanly, you will want to fix it so the maintainer can easily merge it. GitHub will test this for you and let you know at the bottom of every Pull Request if the merge is trivial or not.
					</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= xml:id="_pr_fail" class="imageblock"-->
<!-- div attr= class="content"-->

<!-- div attr= class="title"-->
<!--</div attr= class="title">--><!--</div attr= xml:id="_pr_fail" class="imageblock">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
					<p>
						If you see something like <url href="ch00/_pr_fail">Pull Request does not merge cleanly</url>, you’ll want to fix your branch so that it turns green and the maintainer doesn’t have to do extra work.
					</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
					<p>
						You have two main options in order to do this. You can either rebase your branch on top of whatever the target branch is (normally the <c>main</c> branch of the repository you forked), or you can merge the target branch into your branch.
					</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
					<p>
						Most developers on GitHub will choose to do the latter, for the same reasons we just went over in the previous section. What matters is the history and the final merge, so rebasing isn’t getting you much other than a slightly cleaner history and in return is <term>far</term> more difficult and error prone.
					</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
					<p>
						If you want to merge in the target branch to make your Pull Request mergeable, you would add the original repository as a new remote, fetch from it, merge the main branch of that repository into your topic branch, fix any issues and finally push it back up to the same branch you opened the Pull Request on.
					</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
					<p>
						For example, let’s say that in the “tonychacon” example we were using before, the original author made a change that would create a conflict in the Pull Request. Let’s go through those steps.

						One of the great things about Git is that you can do that continuously. If you have a very long-running project, you can easily merge from the target branch over and over again and only have to deal with conflicts that have arisen since the last time that you merged, making the process very manageable.
					</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
					<p>
						If you absolutely wish to rebase the branch to clean it up, you can certainly do so, but it is highly encouraged to not force push over the branch that the Pull Request is already opened on. If other people have pulled it down and done more work on it, you run into all of the issues outlined in <url href="ch00/_rebase_peril">The Perils of Rebasing</url>. Instead, push the rebased branch to a new branch on GitHub and open a brand new Pull Request referencing the old one, then close the original.

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
					<p>
						Your next question may be “How do I reference the old Pull Request?”. It turns out there are many, many ways to reference other things almost anywhere you can write in GitHub.
					</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
					<p>
						Let’s start with how to cross-reference another Pull Request or an Issue. All Pull Requests and Issues are assigned numbers and they are unique within the project. For example, you can’t have Pull Request #3 <em>and</em> Issue #3. If you want to reference any Pull Request or Issue from any other one, you can simply put <c>#&lt;num&gt;</c> in any comment or description. You can also be more specific if the Issue or Pull request lives somewhere else; write <c>username#&lt;num&gt;</c> if you’re referring to an Issue or Pull Request in a fork of the repository you’re in, or <c>username/repo#&lt;num&gt;</c> to reference something in another repository.
					</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
					<p>
						Let’s look at an example. Say we rebased the branch in the previous example, created a new pull request for it, and now we want to reference the old pull request from the new one. We also want to reference an issue in the fork of the repository and an issue in a completely different project. We can fill out the description just like <url href="ch00/_pr_references">Cross references in a Pull Request</url>.
					</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
					<p>
						Now if Tony goes back and closes out the original Pull Request, we can see that by mentioning it in the new one, GitHub has automatically created a trackback event in the Pull Request timeline. This means that anyone who visits this Pull Request and sees that it is closed can easily link back to the one that superseded it. The link will look something like <url href="ch00/_pr_closed">Link back to the new Pull Request in the closed Pull Request timeline</url>.
					</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

					<p>
						In addition to issue numbers, you can also reference a specific commit by SHA-1. You have to specify a full 40 character SHA-1, but if GitHub sees that in a comment, it will link directly to the commit. Again, you can reference commits in forks or other repositories in the same way you did with issues.

					Linking to other Issues is just the beginning of interesting things you can do with almost any text box on GitHub. In Issue and Pull Request descriptions, comments, code comments and more, you can use what is called “GitHub Flavored Markdown”. Markdown is like writing in plain text but which is rendered richly.
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->

					See <url href="ch00/_example_markdown">An example of GitHub Flavored Markdown as written and as rendered</url> for an example of how comments or text can be written and then rendered using Markdown.

				<p>
					The GitHub flavor of Markdown adds more things you can do beyond the basic Markdown syntax. These can all be really useful when creating useful Pull Request or Issue comments or descriptions.
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="sect4"-->

				<paragraphs xml:id="_task_lists">
					<title>Task Lists</title>

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
					<p>
						The first really useful GitHub specific Markdown feature, especially for use in Pull Requests, is the Task List. A task list is a list of checkboxes of things you want to get done. Putting them into an Issue or Pull Request normally indicates things that you want to get done before you consider the item complete.
					</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
					<p>
						You can create a task list like this:
					</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="listingblock"-->
<!-- div attr= class="content"-->
					<pre>- [X] Write the code
- [ ] Write all the tests
- [ ] Document the code</pre><!--</div attr= class="content">--><!--</div attr= class="listingblock">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
					<p>
						If we include this in the description of our Pull Request or Issue, we’ll see it rendered like <url href="ch00/_eg_task_lists">Task lists rendered in a Markdown comment</url>.
					</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= xml:id="_eg_task_lists" class="imageblock"-->
<!-- div attr= class="content"-->
                    <figure xml:id="github-markdown-02-tasks">

<!-- div attr= class="title"-->
<!--</div attr= class="title">--><!--</div attr= xml:id="_eg_task_lists" class="imageblock">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
					<p>
						This is often used in Pull Requests to indicate what all you would like to get done on the branch before the Pull Request will be ready to merge. The really cool part is that you can simply click the checkboxes to update the comment — you don’t have to edit the Markdown directly to check tasks off.
					</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
					<p>
						What’s more, GitHub will look for task lists in your Issues and Pull Requests and show them as metadata on the pages that list them out. For example, if you have a Pull Request with tasks and you look at the overview page of all Pull Requests, you can see how far done it is. This helps people break down Pull Requests into subtasks and helps other people track the progress of the branch. You can see an example of this in <url href="ch00/_task_list_progress">Task list summary in the Pull Request list</url>.
					</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!--</div attr= class="title">--><!--</div attr= xml:id="_task_list_progress" class="imageblock">-->

				<paragraphs xml:id="_code_snippets">
					<title>Code Snippets</title>

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
					<p>
						You can also add code snippets to comments. This is especially useful if you want to present something that you <em>could</em> try to do before actually implementing it as a commit on your branch. This is also often used to add example code of what is not working or what this Pull Request could implement.
					</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
					<p>
						To add a snippet of code you have to “fence” it in backticks.
					</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="listingblock"-->
<!-- div attr= class="content"-->

}
```</pre><!--</div attr= class="content">--><!--</div attr= class="listingblock">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->

						If you’re responding to a small part of a long comment, you can selectively quote out of the other comment by preceding the lines with the <c>&gt;</c> character. In fact, this is so common and so useful that there is a keyboard shortcut for it. If you highlight text in a comment that you want to directly reply to and hit the <c>r</c> key, it will quote that text in the comment box for you.

				<title>Keep your GitHub public repository up-to-date</title>

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					Once you’ve forked a GitHub repository, your repository (your "fork") exists independently from the original. In particular, when the original repository has new commits, GitHub informs you by a message like:
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="listingblock"-->
<!-- div attr= class="content"-->
				<pre>This branch is 5 commits behind progit:main.</pre><!--</div attr= class="content">--><!--</div attr= class="listingblock">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					But your GitHub repository will never be automatically updated by GitHub; this is something that you must do yourself. Fortunately, this is very easy to do.
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					One possibility to do this requires no configuration. For example, if you forked from <url href="https://github.com/progit/progit2.git"><c>https://github.com/progit/progit2.git</c></url>, you can keep your default branch up-to-date like this:
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="listingblock"-->
<!-- div attr= class="content"-->
				<pre>$ git checkout main (1)
$ git pull https://github.com/progit/progit2.git (2)
$ git push origin main (3)</pre><!--</div attr= class="content">--><!--</div attr= class="listingblock">-->

<!-- div attr= class="colist arabic"-->
				<p><ol>
					<li>
									<p>
					If you were on another branch, return to <c>main</c>.
				</p>
					</li>

					<li>
									<p>
					Fetch changes from <url href="https://github.com/progit/progit2.git"><c>https://github.com/progit/progit2.git</c></url> and merge them into <c>main</c>.
				</p>
					</li>

					<li>
									<p>
					Push your <c>main</c> branch to <c>origin</c>.
				</p>
					</li>

				</ol></p><!--</div attr= class="colist arabic">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					This works, but it is a little tedious having to spell out the fetch URL every time. You can automate this work with a bit of configuration:
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="listingblock"-->
<!-- div attr= class="content"-->
				<pre>$ git remote add progit https://github.com/progit/progit2.git (1)
$ git fetch progit (2)
$ git branch --set-upstream-to=progit/main main (3)
$ git config --local remote.pushDefault origin (4)</pre><!--</div attr= class="content">--><!--</div attr= class="listingblock">-->

<!-- div attr= class="colist arabic"-->
				<p><ol>
					<li>
									<p>
					Add the source repository and give it a name. Here, I have chosen to call it <c>progit</c>.
				</p>
					</li>

					<li>
									<p>
					Get a reference on progit’s branches, in particular <c>main</c>.
				</p>
					</li>

					<li>
									<p>
					Set your <c>main</c> branch to fetch from the <c>progit</c> remote.
				</p>
					</li>

					<li>
									<p>
					Define the default push repository to <c>origin</c>.
				</p>
					</li>

				</ol></p><!--</div attr= class="colist arabic">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					Once this is done, the workflow becomes much simpler:
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="listingblock"-->
<!-- div attr= class="content"-->
				<pre>$ git checkout main (1)
$ git pull (2)
$ git push (3)</pre><!--</div attr= class="content">--><!--</div attr= class="listingblock">-->

<!-- div attr= class="colist arabic"-->
				<p><ol>
					<li>
									<p>
					If you were on another branch, return to <c>main</c>.
				</p>
					</li>

					<li>
									<p>
					Fetch changes from <c>progit</c> and merge changes into <c>main</c>.
				</p>
					</li>

					<li>
									<p>
					Push your <c>main</c> branch to <c>origin</c>.
				</p>
					</li>

				</ol></p><!--</div attr= class="colist arabic">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					This approach can be useful, but it’s not without downsides. Git will happily do this work for you silently, but it won’t warn you if you make a commit to <c>main</c>, pull from <c>progit</c>, then push to <c>origin</c> — all of those operations are valid with this setup. So you’ll have to take care never to commit directly to <c>main</c>, since that branch effectively belongs to the upstream repository.

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->

					All you really have to do here is provide a project name; the rest of the fields are completely optional. For now, just click the “Create Repository” button, and boom – you have a new repository on GitHub, named <c>&lt;user&gt;/&lt;project_name&gt;</c>.
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					Since you have no code there yet, GitHub will show you instructions for how to create a brand-new Git repository, or connect an existing Git project. We won’t belabor this here; if you need a refresher, check out <url href="ch00/ch02-git-basics-chapter">Git Basics</url>.
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					Now that your project is hosted on GitHub, you can give the URL to anyone you want to share your project with. Every project on GitHub is accessible over HTTPS as <c>https://github.com/&lt;user&gt;/&lt;project_name&gt;</c>, and over SSH as <c>git@github.com:&lt;user&gt;/&lt;project_name&gt;</c>. Git can fetch from and push to both of these URLs, but they are access-controlled based on the credentials of the user connecting to them.
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="admonitionblock note"-->

				<p>
					Note: It is often preferable to share the HTTPS based URL for a public project, since the user does not have to have a GitHub account to access it for cloning. Users will have to have an account and an uploaded SSH key to access your project if you give them the SSH URL. The HTTPS one is also exactly the same URL they would paste into a browser to view the project there.

If Ben, Jeff, and Louise all sign up for accounts on GitHub, and you want to give them push access to your repository, you can add them to your project.

				<title>Managing Pull Requests</title>

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					Now that you have a project with some code in it and maybe even a few collaborators who also have push access, let’s go over what to do when you get a Pull Request yourself.
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					Pull Requests can either come from a branch in a fork of your repository or they can come from another branch in the same repository. The only difference is that the ones in a fork are often from people where you can’t push to their branch and they can’t push to yours, whereas with internal Pull Requests generally both parties can access the branch.
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					For these examples, let’s assume you are “tonychacon” and you’ve created a new Arduino code project named “fade”.

					<title>Email Notifications</title>

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
					<p>
						Someone comes along and makes a change to your code and sends you a Pull Request. You should get an email notifying you about the new Pull Request and it should look something like <url href="ch00/_email_pr">Email notification of a new Pull Request</url>.
					</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

                    <figure xml:id="github-maint-01-email">

<!--</div attr= class="title">--><!--</div attr= xml:id="_email_pr" class="imageblock">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
					<p>
						There are a few things to notice about this email. It will give you a small diffstat — a list of files that have changed in the Pull Request and by how much. It gives you a link to the Pull Request on GitHub. It also gives you a few URLs that you can use from the command line.
					</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
					<p>
						If you notice the line that says <c>git pull &lt;url&gt; patch-1</c>, this is a simple way to merge in a remote branch without having to add a remote. We went over this quickly in <url href="ch00/_checking_out_remotes">Checking Out Remote Branches</url>. If you wish, you can create and switch to a topic branch and then run this command to merge in the Pull Request changes.
					</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
					<p>
						The other interesting URLs are the <c>.diff</c> and <c>.patch</c> URLs, which as you may guess, provide unified diff and patch versions of the Pull Request. You could technically merge in the Pull Request work with something like this:

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
					<p>
						As we covered in <url href="ch00/ch06-github_flow">The GitHub Flow</url>, you can now have a conversation with the person who opened the Pull Request. You can comment on specific lines of code, comment on whole commits or comment on the entire Pull Request itself, using GitHub Flavored Markdown everywhere.
					</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
					<p>
						Every time someone else comments on the Pull Request you will continue to get email notifications so you know there is activity happening. They will each have a link to the Pull Request where the activity is happening and you can also directly respond to the email to comment on the Pull Request thread.

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->

						Once the code is in a place you like and want to merge it in, you can either pull the code down and merge it locally, either with the <c>git pull &lt;url&gt; &lt;branch&gt;</c> syntax we saw earlier, or by adding the fork as a remote and fetching and merging.
					</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
					<p>
						If the merge is trivial, you can also just hit the “Merge” button on the GitHub site. This will do a “non-fast-forward” merge, creating a merge commit even if a fast-forward merge was possible. This means that no matter what, every time you hit the merge button, a merge commit is created. As you can see in <url href="ch00/_merge_button">Merge button and instructions for merging a Pull Request manually</url>, GitHub gives you all of this information if you click the hint link.

					</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
					<p>
						If you see a Pull Request that is moving in the right direction and you have an idea for a change that depends on it or you’re not sure is a good idea, or you just don’t have push access to the target branch, you can open a Pull Request directly to it.
					</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
					<p>
						When you go to open a Pull Request, there is a box at the top of the page that specifies which branch you’re requesting to pull to and which you’re requesting to pull from. If you hit the “Edit” button at the right of that box you can change not only the branches but also which fork.

				<title>Mentions and Notifications</title>

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					GitHub also has a pretty nice notifications system built in that can come in handy when you have questions or need feedback from specific individuals or teams.
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					In any comment you can start typing a <c>@</c> character and it will begin to autocomplete with the names and usernames of people who are collaborators or contributors in the project.

<!-- div attr= class="title"-->
<!--</div attr= class="title">--><!--</div attr= class="imageblock">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					You can also mention a user who is not in that dropdown, but often the autocompleter can make it faster.
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					Once you post a comment with a user mention, that user will be notified. This means that this can be a really effective way of pulling people into conversations rather than making them poll. Very often in Pull Requests on GitHub people will pull in other people on their teams or in their company to review an Issue or Pull Request.
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					If someone gets mentioned on a Pull Request or Issue, they will be “subscribed” to it and will continue getting notifications any time some activity occurs on it. You will also be subscribed to something if you opened it, if you’re watching the repository or if you comment on something. If you no longer wish to receive notifications, there is an “Unsubscribe” button on the page you can click to stop receiving updates on it.

					<title>The Notifications Page</title>

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
					<p>
						When we mention “notifications” here with respect to GitHub, we mean a specific way that GitHub tries to get in touch with you when events happen and there are a few different ways you can configure them. If you go to the “Notification center” tab from the settings page, you can see some of the options you have.
					</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

                    </figure>


<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
					<p>
						The two choices are to get notifications over “Email” and over “Web” and you can choose either, neither or both for when you actively participate in things and for activity on repositories you are watching.
					</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="sect5"-->

					<paragraphs xml:id="_web_notifications">
						<title>Web Notifications</title>

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
						<p>
							Web notifications only exist on GitHub and you can only check them on GitHub. If you have this option selected in your preferences and a notification is triggered for you, you will see a small blue dot over your notifications icon at the top of your screen as seen in <url href="ch00/_not_center">Notification center</url>.
						</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

                        <figure xml:id="github-maint-08-notifications-page">

<!--</div attr= class="title">--><!--</div attr= xml:id="_not_center" class="imageblock">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
						<p>
							If you click on that, you will see a list of all the items you have been notified about, grouped by project. You can filter to the notifications of a specific project by clicking on its name in the left hand sidebar. You can also acknowledge the notification by clicking the checkmark icon next to any notification, or acknowledge <em>all</em> of the notifications in a project by clicking the checkmark at the top of the group. There is also a mute button next to each checkmark that you can click to not receive any further notifications on that item.
						</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
						<p>
							All of these tools are very useful for handling large numbers of notifications. Many GitHub power users will simply turn off email notifications entirely and manage all of their notifications through this screen.

<!-- div attr= class="sect5"-->

						<paragraphs xml:id="_email_notifications_2">
							<title>Email Notifications</title>

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
							<p>
								Email notifications are the other way you can handle notifications through GitHub. If you have this turned on you will get emails for each notification. We saw examples of this in <url href="ch00/_email_notification">Comments sent as email notifications</url> and <url href="ch00/_email_pr">Email notification of a new Pull Request</url>. The emails will also be threaded properly, which is nice if you’re using a threading email client.
							</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
							<p>
								There is also a fair amount of metadata embedded in the headers of the emails that GitHub sends you, which can be really helpful for setting up custom filters and rules.
							</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
							<p>
								For instance, if we look at the actual email headers sent to Tony in the email shown in <url href="ch00/_email_pr">Email notification of a new Pull Request</url>, we will see the following among the information sent:
							</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="listingblock"-->
<!-- div attr= class="content"-->
							<pre>To: tonychacon/fade &lt;fade@noreply.github.com&gt;
Message-ID: &lt;tonychacon/fade/pull/1@github.com&gt;
Subject: [fade] Wait longer to see the dimming effect better (#1)
X-GitHub-Recipient: tonychacon
List-ID: tonychacon/fade &lt;fade.tonychacon.github.com&gt;
List-Archive: https://github.com/tonychacon/fade
List-Post: &lt;mailto:reply+i-4XXX@reply.github.com&gt;
List-Unsubscribe: &lt;mailto:unsub+i-XXX@reply.github.com&gt;,...
X-GitHub-Recipient-Address: tchacon@example.com</pre><!--</div attr= class="content">--><!--</div attr= class="listingblock">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
							<p>
								There are a couple of interesting things here. If you want to highlight or re-route emails to this particular project or even Pull Request, the information in <c>Message-ID</c> gives you all the data in <c>&lt;user&gt;/&lt;project&gt;/&lt;type&gt;/&lt;id&gt;</c> format. If this were an issue, for example, the <c>&lt;type&gt;</c> field would have been “issues” rather than “pull”.
							</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
							<p>
								The <c>List-Post</c> and <c>List-Unsubscribe</c> fields mean that if you have a mail client that understands those, you can easily post to the list or “Unsubscribe” from the thread. That would be essentially the same as clicking the “mute” button on the web version of the notification or “Unsubscribe” on the Issue or Pull Request page itself.
							</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
							<p>
								It’s also worth noting that if you have both email and web notifications enabled and you read the email version of the notification, the web version will be marked as read as well if you have images allowed in your mail client.

				<title>Special Files</title>

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					There are a number of special files that GitHub will notice if they are present in your repository.
					We detail a few of the most common ones. Note that these can typically be written in any format that Github recognizes as prose.
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">--><!--</div attr= class="sect3">-->

<!-- div attr= class="sect3"-->
			</paragraphs>
			<paragraphs xml:id="_license">
				<title>LICENSE</title>
			<p>
			The first is the LICENSE file, which can be of nearly any prose format. For example, it could be LICENSE, LICENSE.md, LICENSE.asciidoc, etc. 
			</p>
			<p>
			The license file explains the respostory's legal license, including any legal rights, any copyright restrictions, etc. When you include a detectable license in your repository, people who visit your repository will see it at the top of the repository page.
			</p>
			<p>
				For more information on how to add a license, see <url href="https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-license-to-a-repository/" visual="help.github.com/articles/adding-a-license-to-a-repository/">Adding a license to a repository</url> 
			</p>
			</paragraphs>

			<paragraphs xml:id="_readme">
				<title>README</title>

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					The <c>README</c> file explains your project, what it does, why it is useful, etc.
					If GitHub detects a README file in your source, it will render it on the landing page of the project,
					so this file is often the first item a visitor will see when visiting your repository.
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					Many teams use this file to hold all the relevant project information for someone who might be new to the repository or project. This generally includes things like:
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

<!-- div attr= class="ulist"-->
				<p><ul>
					<li>
									<p>
					What the project is for
				</p>
					</li>

					<li>

					<li>
									<p>
					How to contribute to it
				</p>
					</li>

				</ul></p><!--</div attr= class="ulist">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					Since GitHub will render this file, you can embed images or links in it for added ease of understanding.
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">--><!--</div attr= class="sect3">-->

<!-- div attr= class="sect3"-->
			</paragraphs>

			<paragraphs xml:id="_code_of_conduct">
				<title>CODE_OF_CONDUCT</title>
				<p>
					The CODE_OF_CONDUCT explains how one is expected to engage in that particular community. It is typically used to ensure an inclusive environment that respects all people and also typically describes how to address any problems among members of the project's community.
				</p>
			</paragraphs>

			<paragraphs xml:id="_contributing">
				<title>CONTRIBUTING</title>

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					Another special file that GitHub recognizes is the <c>CONTRIBUTING</c> file. If you have a file named <c>CONTRIBUTING</c> with any file extension, GitHub will show <url href="ch00/_contrib_file">Opening a Pull Request when a CONTRIBUTING file exists</url> when anyone starts opening a Pull Request.
				</p><!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

                <figure xml:id="github-maint-09-contrib">

<!-- div attr= class="title"-->
<!--</div attr= class="title">--><!--</div attr= xml:id="_contrib_file" class="imageblock">-->

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
				<p>
					The idea here is that you can specify specific things you want or don’t want in a Pull Request sent to your project. This way people may actually read the guidelines before opening the Pull Request.

			<paragraphs xml:id="_project_administration">
				<title>Project Administration</title>

<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
