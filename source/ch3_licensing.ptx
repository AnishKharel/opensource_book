  <title>Open Source Licensing</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>An open-source license is a type of license for things like software and other products that allows the source code or design to be used, modified and/or shared under specific terms and conditions. An open source license allows people to review and modify the source code or design for their own purposes.</p>

  <conclusion>
    <p>If you find software that doesn’t seem to have a license, that generally means you have no permission from the creators of the software to use, modify, or share the software. Although a code host such as <url href="https://github.com/" visual="github.com">GitHub</url> may allow you to view and even make a copy of the code, this does not imply that you are permitted to use, modify, or share the software for any purpose.</p>
