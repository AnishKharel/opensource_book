  <title>Open Source Licensing</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>An open source license formalizes what people are permitted to do with the material that is open source and under what conditions. For example, this might address whether you are granted the rights to use, modify, or distribute (commercially or non-commercially) the material.
    </p>
