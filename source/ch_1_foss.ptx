  <introduction>
			<p>
				Free and Open Source Software, or FOSS for short, is software for which the source code can be freely shared, with anyone, for any purpose.
			</p>

			<p>
				There are more rigorous definitions, and there are many licenses that help to ensure these freedoms in subtly different ways. We examine these details later in the book. For now, focus on this simple idea: the freedom to share source code is the essential element of free and open source software.

      <p><ul>
				<li>
				Understand the difference between source code and binary code;
