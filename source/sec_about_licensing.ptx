  <title>About Licensing</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      The primary purpose of licensing is to set rules by which something can be uses by others.

    <title>Important IP Terminology</title>
    <p>
      Here we give a few definitions that are important for the remainder of the chapter. Note that these these are intended not as legal defnitions but to help in understanding the common usage of these terms.

    For the first term, <term>Intellectual Property</term>, you can think "property" (like software) that is "intellectual" in nature, but it refers to more than just the property itself.

    <definition xml:id="def-Intellectual-Property">
    <idx>intellectural property</idx>
            
      <statement>
        <p>
          <term>Intellectual property</term> or <term>IP</term> refers both to the "property" that is created by efforts of the mind and to the <em>legal rights</em> related to this property. 
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
      </p>
        
      <p>
      For the term, <term>copyright</term>, you can think <em>restrictions</em> on things like the "right" to "copy".  The following definition comes from the <url href="https://www.copyright.gov/what-is-copyright/" visual="www.copyright.gov/what-is-copyright">Copyright Office of the US government</url>. You will note that copyright refers to much more than solely the right to copy or not to copy.

      <definition xml:id="def-copyright">
      <idx>copyright</idx>
        <statement>
          <p>
            A <term>copyright</term> is a type of intellectual property that protects original works of authorship as soon as an author fixes the work in a tangible form of expression. 
          </p>
        </statement>
      </definition>
      This means that as soon as an author makes it and writes it in code or other tangible form, the author holds a copyright to that work. 
      </p>
      <p>
      A copyright offers the copyright owner exclusive rights limiting permissions like:	
      <ul>
        <li>
          Private use
        </li>
        <li>
         Commercial use
        </li>
        <li>
          Distribution
        </li>
        <li>
          Modification
        </li>

      </ul>
      Copyright also provides the owner of copyright the exclusive right to authorize others to utilize these  rights, subject to certain stated conditions and limitations. 
    </p>

    <p>
      The next term, <term>copyleft</term> is one that you may not have heard before because it has emerged from the open source movement. It is also a very clear word play on the word copyright and suggests having "left" some of the author's "rights." And, that is indeed what it is, but don't assume that all rights have been abandoned by the author, far from it!
    </p>
        
    <p>
        The <url href="https://copyleft.org/guide/comprehensive-gpl-guidech3.html" visual="copyleft.org/guide/comprehensive-gpl-guidech3.html">Copyleft Foundation</url> states the following as the essential innovation of copyleft in section 2.2:

      <definition xml:id="def-copyleft">
      <idx>copyleft</idx>
        <statement>
          <p>
            <term>Copyleft</term> uses the copyright holders’ controls on permission to modify the work to add a conditional requirement. Namely, downstream users may only have permission to modify the work if they pass along the same permissions on the modified version that came originally to them.
          </p>
        </statement>
      </definition>

    </p>

    <p>
      The next term, <term>fair use</term> is perhaps hardest to understand, but critically important because fair uses can be made without permission from the copyright owner.


    <definition xml:id="def-fair-use">
      <statement>
      <idx>fair use</idx>
        <p>
          Loosely speaking, <term>fair use</term> is copying of copyrighted material done for a "limited" and also “transformative” purpose. 
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>
    </p>
      
    <p>
      What does <em>that</em> mean? Well, many millions of dollars have been spent arguing just that question. Fair use is often used by various types of critics to quote a limited portion of a work and by professors to make a limited portion of a work available to thier students. 
    </p>
      
    <p>
      If you really want to just see how confusing this term is, see <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_LLC_v._Oracle_America,_Inc." visual="wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_LLC_v._Oracle_America,_Inc.">Google v. Oracle</url> which ultimately unded up in the US Supreme Court battling exactly that question.
