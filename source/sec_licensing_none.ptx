    <title>In the Absense of a License</title>
    
		<p>
			Even in the absence of a license file, you may grant some rights in cases where you publish your source code to a site that requires accepting terms of service. For example, if you publish your source code in a public repository on GitHub, you have accepted the <url href="https://help.github.com/articles/github-terms-of-service" visual="help.github.com/articles/github-terms-of-service">Terms of Service</url>, by which you allow others to view and fork your repository. Others may not need your permission if <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limitations_and_exceptions_to_copyright" visual="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limitations_and_exceptions_to_copyright">limitations and exceptions to copyright</url> apply to their particular situation. Neither site terms nor jurisdiction-specific copyright limitations are sufficient for the kinds of collaboration that people usually seek on a public code host, such as experimentation, modification, and sharing as fostered by an open source license.
		</p>

		<p>
			You don’t have to do anything to <em>not</em> offer a license. You may, however, wish to add a copyright notice and statement that you are not offering any license in a prominent place (e.g., your project’s README) so that users don’t assume you made an oversight. If you’re going to accept others’ contributions to your non-licensed project, you may wish to explore adding a contributor agreement to your project with your lawyer so that you maintain copyright permission from contributors, even though you’re not granting the same.
		</p>

		<p>
			Disallowing use of your code might not be what you intend by posting “no license.” An open source license allows reuse of your code while you retain the copyright. If your goal is to completely opt-out of copyright restrictions, try a public domain dedication instead.

	<title>For potential users</title>

		<p>
			If you find software that doesn’t seem to have a license, that generally means you have been granted no permission from the creators of the software at all. Although a code host such as <url href="https://github.com/" visual="github.com">GitHub</url> may allow you to view and even make a copy of the code, this does not imply that you are permitted to use, modify, or share the software for any purpose. 
		</p>

		<p>
			To be clear, if software has no license at all, that  means you have been granted <em>no</em> permission from the creators of the software to use, modify, or share the software, so you had best not do so. 
		</p>

		<p>
			If you find software without a posted license, your options are:
		</p>

		<p><ul>
			<li>
			<title>Ask the maintainers nicely to add a license</title> 
				Unless the software includes strong indications to the contrary, lack of a license is probably an oversight. If the software is hosted on a site like GitHub, open an issue requesting a license. If you’re bold and it’s fairly obvious what license is most appropriate, open a pull request to add a license.
			</li>

			<li>
			<title>Don’t use the software</title> 
				Find or create an alternative that is under an open source license.
			</li>

			<li>
			<title>Negotiate a private license</title> 
				Be sure to bring your lawyer.
			</li>

			</ul></p>
