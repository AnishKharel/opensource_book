  <title>What is Open Source Software?</title>
      <p>
        This is, first and foremost, a textbook about people create software collaboratively, using a community development model, and about how you can become a member of one of those communities.
      </p>
      <p>
        <idx>free software</idx>   
        <idx>free and open source software</idx>  
        <idx>FOSS</idx>   
        <idx>FLOSS</idx>  
        <idx>free/libre and open source software</idx>   
        Most people call the result of such work by the name <term>open source software (OSS)</term>. Some people call <term>free software</term> or use both terms: <term>free and open source software (FOSS)</term>. Some people throw in the word libre to specify a particular meaning of free, and call it <term>free/libre open source software (FLOSS)</term>. 
      </p>

      <p>
        There are valid reasons for the usage of these different terms in different contexts, but for the sake of simplicity, we primarily use the terms <term>open source</term> or <term>open source software (OSS)</term> primarily in this book, with the tacit understanding that all terms mean virtually the same thing in our chosen context.
      </p>

      <p>
      The specific defination of the term as we will use it: 

      <definition xml:id="def-open-source">
        <idx>open source</idx>
        <idx>open source software</idx>
        <idx>OSS</idx>
        <statement>
          <p>
            <term>Open source software (OSS)</term> is software that is designed with code that is publicly accessible and freely shared.
          </p>
        </statement>
      </definition>
      </p>

      <p>Open source software is typically developed in a collaborative way. It often relies upon peer review and community member contributions, frequently with community members from all over the world. In addition to seeing the code, often anyone can also freely modify and distribute the code as they see fit as long as the open source license is followed. We will explore licensing details in <xref ref="ch_licensing"/>
      </p>

      <p>
        Enough of the pep talk. Its time to get started.
