  <title>Version Control with Git</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
    <!-- TODO -need a more appropriate introduction... that is not just about the first section-->
			This chapter is about version control with a focus on using Git for version control. We begin by discussing why you need version control, explaining some background on version control tools, move on to how to get Git running on your system, and finally we help you to start working with Git. By the end of this chapter you should understand why version control exists, why you should use one, and you should be all set up to begin to do so.
