  <title>Bugs and Debugging</title>
  <introduction>
			<p>
				It would be foolhardy to try to teach the practice of software quality assurance in one chapter. It’s a vast field, and there are plenty of places to learn about the difference between <em>white-box</em> and <em>black-box</em> testing, or how to write the best possible <em>regression tests</em>. Those are all worthy fields of study, and you should pursue them — but they are far beyond the scope of this chapter.
			</p>

			<p>
				Besides, the simple fact is that for most software projects, bugs are not so uncommon that you need to go looking for them. They find you. Sometimes in bunches.
			</p>

			<p>
				What makes open source interesting, and different, is that <em>you can actually do something about the bugs</em>.
			</p>

			<p>
				Eric S. Raymond once said that “with enough eyes, all bugs are shallow.” This aphorism has become one of the central tenets of open source — but it’s only half of the story. The real strength of open source lies in the ability of motivated individuals to record, research, and resolve those bugs. Seeing bugs is one thing; reporting them is another; fixing them is something else.
			</p>

			<p>
				In this chapter, you learn some of the practical techniques that open source developers use to find, report, investigate, and fix bugs — and you begin to contribute, in earnest, to real open source projects. You will join the global collaborative effort to solve real problems, for real users, in real software.

  <title>More Advice on Bug Reports</title>

				<li>
				The Fedora project has good guidelines for bug reporters at <url href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/How_to_file_a_bug_report">How to file a bug report</url>. A bit specific to Fedora in places, but very instructive.
				</li>

				<li>
				The Mozilla project also has a set of <url href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/QA/Bug_writing_guidelines">bug reporting guidelines</url>, and a great <url href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/page.cgi?id=etiquette.html">etiquette guide</url> as well. Specific to Mozilla, but instructive.

				Simon Tatham’s <url href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html">How to Report Bugs Effectively</url> is a truly outstanding work. Strongly recommended.
